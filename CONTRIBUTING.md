# Contributing to Academic Research Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains what kinds of contributions we accept and how to submit them.

## How to submit a contribution

ARS uses the standard **fork-and-PR** workflow. Fork the repo on GitHub, clone your fork, create a branch, make your changes, push to your fork, then open a PR against `zzyu17/academic-research-skills-copilot`.

**Important**: You cannot push directly to this repo — you must fork it first and submit a PR from your fork.

## What we accept

### Community-maintained (fast merge)

These contributions can be merged quickly with minimal review:

- **Typo and formatting fixes** — spelling, broken links, markdown rendering issues
- **New examples** — pipeline output showcases, worked examples for specific disciplines
- **Translation improvements** — better zh-TW or EN phrasing in READMEs or agent definitions

### Requires maintainer review

These need careful review because they affect system behavior:

- **Journal and field reference lists** — additions to `top_journals_by_field.md`, new discipline glossaries
- **Evaluation sets** — gold-standard papers for calibration mode, benchmark data
- **New reference files** — methodology guides, citation format references, domain-specific protocols
- **Bug and drift fixes** — version inconsistencies, broken cross-references, incorrect metadata
- **Mode changes** — new modes, trigger keyword changes, oversight level adjustments

### Requires maintainer approval + discussion

Open an issue first before submitting a PR for these:

- **Agent definition changes** — modifications to any file in `*/agents/*.md`
- **IRON RULE modifications** — any change to rules marked with the IRON RULE marker
- **Ethics and integrity rules** — changes to the failure mode checklist, integrity protocols, or ethics review
- **Handoff schema changes** — modifications to `shared/handoff_schemas.md`
- **New skills or modes** — additions to the pipeline

### Upstream and platform-specific changes

This repository is the community-maintained Copilot CLI sibling distribution. Portable workflow, agent, schema, and research-method changes should normally be proposed to the [Claude Code reference distribution](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills) first, then ported here through [`docs/UPDATE-AND-PORT-WORKFLOW.md`](docs/UPDATE-AND-PORT-WORKFLOW.md). Copilot-specific changes belong here when they affect `extension.mjs`, `ars-bootstrap`, plugin packaging, SDK hook behavior, or Copilot documentation/tests. New ports for additional platforms should be maintained in their own sibling distribution rather than nested inside this adapter.

## PR guidelines

- **One concern per PR** — don't mix unrelated changes
- **Describe what and why** — explain the motivation, not just the change
- **Reference issues** — if your PR addresses an open issue, link it
- **Test your changes** — if you're modifying agent definitions, try running the skill to confirm it works as expected
- **Keep READMEs in sync** — if your change affects user-facing documentation, update `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, and `README.ko-KR.md` when applicable

## Governance

### Maintainer

The repo is maintained by [Zhenyu Zhang](https://github.com/zzyu17) (HEEACT). The maintainer has final say on all merges.

### Decision principles

1. **Accuracy over completeness** — we'd rather have fewer, verified journal entries than a long unvetted list
2. **Human-in-the-loop always** — contributions that reduce human oversight or enable fully autonomous paper generation will be declined
3. **No detection evasion** — features designed to make AI-generated text harder to detect (as opposed to higher quality) are out of scope. See [Issue #3](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/3) for context.
4. **Discipline diversity welcome** — ARS defaults to higher education research but aims to be domain-agnostic. Discipline-specific modules are encouraged.

## Release checklist

CI enforces most release mechanics. `scripts/check_version_consistency.py` keeps
`skills/ars-bootstrap/SKILL.md`, product SKILL versions, CHANGELOG, plugin manifests, and
the README badge aligned; the tag gate requires the `vX.Y.Z-copilot` form. Before tagging,
run `python3 scripts/check_changelog_covers_merges.py` from the release-prep state and
resolve every release-worthy merge that is not documented above the previous release.

When a release contains issues found through use on a real paper, add a
`Real-use findings` subsection to that release's CHANGELOG entry. Name the run that surfaced
each issue; omit the subsection when there were no such findings.

---

## Academic integrity policy

This repo is designed to be **assistive, not deceptive**. See [POSITIONING.md](POSITIONING.md) for the full design philosophy. Contributors must not add features designed to evade AI detection tools. If unsure, open an issue to discuss before submitting a PR.

## Credit

Contributors are credited in commit messages, CHANGELOG entries, and the Contributors section of the README. For significant contributions (new features, major reference files), we also add a mention in the relevant release notes.

## License

## When adding a new skill

Read [`shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md`](shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md) before writing the SKILL.md. It explains the three-layer model behind the `data_access_level` and `task_type` frontmatter fields and lists the do/don't rules for handling evaluation rubrics, gold labels, and answer keys.
