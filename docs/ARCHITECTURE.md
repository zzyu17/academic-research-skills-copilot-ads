# ARS Pipeline Architecture (v3.11.1)

Full pipeline view across stages × skills × artifacts × gates. Every completed stage requires a user-confirmation checkpoint (per `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` and `pipeline_state_machine.md`); the diagrams below surface the **decision-heavy** checkpoints visually so they are easy to locate. The post-stage confirmation checkpoints at 2.5 and 4.5 are machine-verified first, then confirmed by the user — they are not skipped.

## How to read

- **Flow diagram** (§2): macro view — which stage follows which, where loops exist, where gates block. Every rectangle ends in a post-stage user confirmation (elided for readability); 🧑 markers call out the decision-heavy moments where the user chooses a branch.
- **Matrix** (§3): the only place where (stage × skill × mode × data_level × artifacts × agents × gate) all co-exist. Use this when asking "what happens at Stage X?" The Gate column lists both machine checks and the user-confirmation checkpoint that closes the stage.
- **Data access flow** (§4) and **skill graph** (§6): orthogonal views answering "who sees what" and "who depends on what" respectively.
- **Literature corpus flow** (§5): producer/consumer view of the optional Material Passport `literature_corpus[]` input port (v3.6.4) and Phase 1 consumer integration (v3.6.5).
- **Quality gates** (§7): zoom on the blocking checks — both machine-enforced and human-enforced.
- **Timeline** (§8): why the architecture looks the way it does — each release added one honesty primitive or a new contract.
- **Modes** (§9): reference when composing a pipeline invocation.

The matrix alone is insufficient: it hides data-access hierarchy and skill dependency. The diagrams alone are insufficient: they hide artifact flow and per-stage agent detail. Together they are the full architecture.

## 1. Checkpoints (at-a-glance)

The pipeline has **two classes of user checkpoint**. Both require the user to confirm before the pipeline advances; they differ in what the user is actually deciding.

**Decision-heavy checkpoints** — the user chooses a branch or accepts a material decision:

| # | Stage | What the user decides |
|---|---|---|
| 🧑 1 | 1. RESEARCH | RQ Brief + Methodology Blueprint |
| 🧑 2 | 2. WRITE | Outline approval before drafting |
| 🧑 3 | 3. REVIEW | Editorial decision (Accept / Minor / Major / Reject) |
| 🧑 4 | 3 → 4 Revision Coaching | Revision strategy (up to 8 Socratic rounds; user can skip) |
| 🧑 5 | 4. REVISE | Revision changes confirmed |
| 🧑 6 | 3'. RE-REVIEW | Verification-review decision |
| 🧑 7 | 3' → 4' Residual Coaching | Residual-issue trade-offs (up to 5 Socratic rounds; user can skip) |
| 🧑 8 | 4'. RE-REVISE | Content frozen — no further review loop |
| 🧑 9 | 5. FINALIZE | Output format selection (MD / DOCX / LaTeX / PDF) |
| 🧑 10 | 6. PROCESS SUMMARY | Language confirmation + collaboration quality review |

**Post-stage confirmation checkpoints** — machine verification runs first; the user then acknowledges the integrity report before proceeding. These are also user-gated (per `pipeline_state_machine.md` — every stage ends in `[checkpoint]`), but the decision is "acknowledge the automated report" rather than "choose a branch":

| # | Stage | What runs | What the user acknowledges |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ 1 | 2.5 INTEGRITY | 7-mode failure checklist (see §3 for exact taxonomy) | Integrity Report PASS/FAIL + any SUSPECTED flags |
| ✓ 2 | 4.5 FINAL INTEGRITY | Deep Mode 2 check, zero-tolerance | Final Integrity Report PASS + populated Material Passport |

**Legend:**

- **Solid orange (✓)** = integrity gate — machine verification runs first, user then acknowledges the report. Not skipped.
- **Green** = Socratic coaching sub-stage. User may engage or say "just fix it" to skip the dialogue.
- **👁 observer** (v3.5.0) = `collaboration_depth_agent` dispatches at every FULL/SLIM checkpoint + pipeline completion. **Never blocks.** Advisory only. MANDATORY integrity gates (2.5 / 4.5) explicitly skip the observer so compliance checks are not diluted.

```

Rules (per `shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md`):

- `data_access_level` is a **declarative** annotation, not a runtime-enforced permission system. The CI lint `scripts/check_data_access_level.py` confirms every `SKILL.md` carries a valid value; it does not inspect context windows at runtime.
- `raw` skills consume layer-1 data (arbitrary, possibly adversarial).
- `redacted` skills operate on sanitized material, no new raw ingestion.
- `verified_only` skills run only after upstream integrity gates.
- The reviewer side **may hold a rubric privately** — the key guarantee is that rubric / gold-label content must not be present in the candidate-generating agent's context. Calibration gold sets are runtime-supplied by the human researcher, not bundled into the repository.
- Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 (plus the user's review at each gate) are the actual enforcement points. This pattern document explains the data-flow structure that makes those gates meaningful; it is not itself a runtime lock.

## 5. Material Passport `literature_corpus[]` Flow (v3.6.4 input port + v3.6.5 consumers)

The Material Passport's `literature_corpus[]` is an **optional** Schema 9 input port for user-curated literature. Producers (out-of-band, before an ARS session) and consumers (Phase 1 literature agents at runtime) sit on opposite sides of the passport.

```mermaid

**Producer side (v3.6.4 input port).** Adapters run out-of-band — before an ARS session, not during. They read a user corpus source and emit `passport.yaml` with `literature_corpus[]` populated and a parallel `rejection_log.yaml` (always emitted; empty when no rejections). Three reference Python adapters ship at `scripts/adapters/{folder_scan,zotero,obsidian}.py`; users are expected to write their own adapters for non-reference sources following [`academic-pipeline/references/adapters/overview.md`](../academic-pipeline/references/adapters/overview.md). Schema validated by `scripts/check_literature_corpus_schema.py`.

**Consumer side (v3.6.5).** Two Phase 1 literature agents read `literature_corpus[]` via the **corpus-first, search-fills-gap** flow — `deep-research/agents/bibliography_agent.md` and `academic-paper/agents/literature_strategist_agent.md`. The flow is presence-based: it auto-engages when the passport carries a non-empty `literature_corpus[]` and parses cleanly. When the corpus is absent, empty, or fails the minimal shape check, each consumer runs its existing external-DB-only flow unchanged (Iron Rule 4 graceful fallback for the failure cases).

**Five-step shared flow.** Step 0 minimal shape check → Step 1 pre-screen corpus against current RQ → Step 2 search-fills-gap (4-case dispatch on `uncovered_topics` × `user_corpus_only`) → Step 3 merge into `final_included` → Step 4 emit Search Strategy report with PRE-SCREENED block. `final_included` stays neutral — no provenance tags on bibliography entries, no provenance column in the Literature Matrix.

**Four Iron Rules** govern every consumer:

1. **Same criteria.** Apply the same Inclusion / Exclusion criteria to corpus entries and external database results. No exceptions.
2. **No silent skip.** Any skipped corpus entry is recorded in the PRE-SCREENED block's skipped sub-section with a reason. Silently dropping an entry is a prompt-layer violation.
3. **No corpus mutation.** Consumer agents never modify, backfill, or derive new content into `literature_corpus[]`. Read only.
4. **Graceful fallback on parse failure.** Consumer agents do NOT re-validate schema, do NOT parse JSON Schema at runtime, and do NOT dereference `source_pointer` URIs. When the corpus cannot be parsed, emit `[CORPUS PARSE FAILURE: <cause>]` and fall back to external-DB-only flow.

**PRE-SCREENED reproducibility block.** Lives inside the Search Strategy section of each consumer's report, immediately before the existing `Databases` line. Enumerates included / excluded / skipped citation_keys with reasons; carries F3 zero-hit note when corpus is non-empty but 0 entries survived screening; carries F4a–F4f provenance reporting for `obtained_via` (adapter origin) and `obtained_at` (snapshot date) covering full / partial / undeclared / wide-spread sub-cases. CI lint `scripts/check_corpus_consumer_protocol.py` enforces nine invariants L1-L9 with manifest-driven consumer list (`scripts/corpus_consumer_manifest.json`) and tuple-matched closed-set state machine.

**Out of v3.6.5 scope.** `citation_compliance_agent` corpus reading is deferred (target version TBD post-v3.8). `source_pointer` URI dereferencing and source verification remain a future `source_verification_agent` concern. Schema is unchanged from v3.6.4 — existing user adapters work without modification.

## 7. Quality Gates

Two classes of gate: **🧑 decision-heavy** (user chooses a branch or approves material) and **✓ integrity** (machine verification + user ack). Pure machine-enforced 🤖 lint checks run in CI.

| Gate | Class | Stage | What blocks advancement | Failure handling |

| Outline approval | 🧑 | 2 | User hasn't approved outline | Revise and re-present |
| Anti-leakage (v3.3) | 🤖 | 2 | Draft contains parametric fill not grounded in session materials | `[MATERIAL GAP]` tag; user provides material or accepts gap |
| VLM figure verify (v3.3) | 🤖 | 2 | Rendered figure fails 10-pt APA 7.0 checklist | Max 2 refinement iterations |
| Stage 2.5 integrity + ack | ✓ | 2.5 | Any mode SUSPECTED on 7-mode checklist, or Modes 1/3/5/6 INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE, or user hasn't acknowledged report | Fix + re-verify (max 3 rounds); or user override with reasoning (logged) |
| Editor-in-Chief decision review | 🧑 | 3 | User hasn't reviewed decision letter | Present decision; await user |
| Concession threshold | 🤖 | 3 | DA rebuttal scored < 4/5 by responder | No concession; frame-lock detector runs |
| Revision Coaching | 🧑 | 3→4 | User hasn't engaged or explicitly skipped (max 8 rounds) | User may say "just fix it" to skip |
| Revision confirmation | 🧑 | 4 | User hasn't confirmed changes | Revise; re-present |
| Revision loop cap | 🤖 | 4 / 3' / 4' | 2 revision loops already consumed | Forced advance to Stage 4.5 |
| Residual Coaching | 🧑 | 3'→4' | User hasn't engaged or explicitly skipped (max 5 rounds) | User may say "just fix it" to skip |
| Content-frozen confirmation | 🧑 | 4' | User hasn't confirmed freeze | Await user; no further review loop permitted |
| Stage 4.5 final integrity + ack | ✓ | 4.5 | ANY issue on deeper 7-mode re-run; mode still SUSPECTED since 2.5 and unresolved | ZERO-tolerance; no skip; fix + re-verify |
| Format selection | 🧑 | 5 | User hasn't chosen output format | Await user format choice |
| Disclosure check | 🤖 | 5 | Venue-specific AI disclosure absent or wrong form | Block render until fixed |
| `repro_lock` (v3.3.5) | 🤖 (standalone) | — | `repro_lock` key required in Material Passport v3.3.5+; value must be either a populated block or explicit `null` (honest opt-out). Populated blocks validated by `check_repro_lock.py`. Per `artifact_reproducibility_pattern.md`: **not** wired into the CI lint suite by default and **not** read by the Stage 2.5 / 4.5 integrity gate at runtime — this is post-hoc documentation, not a pipeline block | Run `check_repro_lock.py <passport>` on demand |
| Language + collaboration review | 🧑 | 6 | User hasn't confirmed output language / reviewed self-reflection | Await user |
| `benchmark_report` (v3.3.5, external) | 🤖 | — | Publishing a benchmark without honest disclosure | Users run `check_benchmark_report.py` before publishing |
| Collaboration Depth Observer (v3.5.0) | 🤖 observer | Every FULL/SLIM checkpoint + pipeline completion | **Never blocks.** Advisory only. Scores user-AI collaboration pattern on 4 dimensions (Delegation Intensity / Cognitive Vigilance / Cognitive Reallocation / Zone Classification) per `shared/collaboration_depth_rubric.md`. Injects a named section into checkpoint presentation and a chapter in the Process Record. MANDATORY integrity gates (2.5 / 4.5) do NOT invoke the observer. | n/a — output is advisory; user `Ready to proceed?` prompt unchanged |
| Reading-check probe (v3.5.1, opt-in) | 🤖 (Mentor sub-layer) | Stage 1 (Socratic mentor session) | Opt-in via `ARS_SOCRATIC_READING_PROBE=1`. Goal-oriented intent only; fires at most once per session when user has cited a specific paper. Decline logged without penalty. Outcome inline in Research Plan Summary; carried into Stage 6 AI Self-Reflection Report. | n/a — non-blocking; flag OFF preserves pre-v3.5.1 behaviour byte-for-byte |
| Sprint Contract hard gate (v3.6.2) | 🤖 + 🧑 | 3 (REVIEW) | Each reviewer must produce a Schema 13 sprint contract (`shared/sprint_contract.schema.json`) BEFORE seeing the paper (Phase 1 metadata-only). Phase 2 paper-visible review consumes the committed contract via `<phase1_output>` data delimiter. `editorial_synthesizer_agent` runs three-step mechanical protocol with forbidden-ops list. Validated by `scripts/check_sprint_contract.py` (structural invariants + 9 soft warnings). Templates: `shared/contracts/reviewer/full.json` (panel 5) + `methodology_focus.json` (panel 2); reserved modes (`re-review` / `calibration` / `guided` / `quick`) keep pre-v3.6.2 behaviour. | Synthesizer rejects post-hoc rubric edits; user sees contract pre-commitment in review log |
| Passport reset boundary (v3.6.3, opt-in) | 🤖 (orchestrator) | FULL checkpoints | Opt-in via `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET=1`. Promotes every FULL checkpoint to a context-reset boundary. `systematic-review` mode with the flag ON makes reset mandatory; other modes treat reset as the flag-gated default. New `resume_from_passport=<hash>` mode in `academic-pipeline` lets users resume in a fresh session from the Material Passport ledger alone. Schema 9 `reset_boundary[]` append-only ledger with `kind: boundary` + `kind: resume` entry types; hash via JSON Canonical Form + SHA-256 + canonical placeholder for self-reference safety. Concurrency contract: POSIX `fcntl.flock LOCK_EX` + bounded timeout ≤60s + non-POSIX fail-loudly. Authoritative protocol: [`academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md`](../academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md). Validated by `scripts/check_passport_reset_contract.py`. | Flag OFF preserves pre-v3.6.3 continuation behaviour byte-for-byte |
| Corpus consumer protocol (v3.6.5) | 🤖 + Phase 1 agents | 1 / 2 (when `literature_corpus[]` present) | Presence-based auto-engage when Material Passport carries non-empty `literature_corpus[]` and parses cleanly. Four Iron Rules (Same criteria / No silent skip / No corpus mutation / Graceful fallback on parse failure). PRE-SCREENED reproducibility block in Search Strategy report (F3 zero-hit + F4a–F4f provenance). Validated by `scripts/check_corpus_consumer_protocol.py` (9 invariants L1-L9 with manifest-driven consumer list). | Parse failure → emit `[CORPUS PARSE FAILURE: <cause>]` and fall back to external-DB-only flow (Iron Rule 4) |
