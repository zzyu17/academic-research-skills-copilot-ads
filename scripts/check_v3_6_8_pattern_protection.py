"""ARS v3.7.1 byte-equivalence SHA gate + Step 3a Two-Layer Citation Emission invariants.

Spec: docs/design/2026-04-30-ars-v3.6.8-trust-provenance-and-drift-transparency-spec.md
      § Step 0 — Lint manifest separation (round-1 codex F-004 amend)
      § Step 3a — Two-Layer Citation Emission (uniform across all modes)

Two layers of enforcement:

1. v3.6.7 boundary SHA gate (Step 0): byte-equivalence on v3.6.7-tagged
   PATTERN PROTECTION blocks listed in scripts/v3_6_7_inversion_manifest.json.
2. v3.6.8 Step 3a invariants on the "Two-Layer Citation Emission (v3.7.1)"
   prompt block in each agent listed in scripts/v3_6_8_inversion_manifest.json:
   (i)   the block specifies the two-layer citation form using a literal
         `<!--ref:` HTML-comment marker AND `<author-year>` visible-form prose
   (ii)  the block does NOT mention "finalizer", "orchestrator", or "stage gate"
         (strict partial-inversion: agent must not know about resolver layers)
   (iii) the block does NOT instruct the agent to read frontmatter

Boundary rule (per spec):
- v3.7.1 work does NOT modify the v3.6.7-tagged PATTERN PROTECTION blocks in
  synthesis_agent.md / research_architect_agent.md / report_compiler_agent.md.
- v3.7.1 MAY add new prompt sections (e.g. "Two-Layer Citation Emission")
  OUTSIDE those v3.6.7-tagged blocks; those v3.6.8-tagged invariants ride
  this script's own manifest (scripts/v3_6_8_inversion_manifest.json).

Single source of truth (round-4 R4-002 + round-5 R5-001 + round-6 R6-002):
- The v3.6.7 frozen manifest at scripts/v3_6_7_inversion_manifest.json is the
  single source of truth for the protected file LIST.
- The v3.6.7 protected CONTENT is whatever the v3.6.7-tagged block shows at
  the v3.6.7 manifest's most recent modifying commit (derived via
  `git log -1 --format=%H scripts/v3_6_7_inversion_manifest.json`).
- v3.7.1 lint computes SHA on demand at runtime: hash(block at PR HEAD) ==
  hash(block at v3.6.7 base commit). No stored expected SHAs; no dual truth.

Shallow-clone safety (round-6 R6-002 + round-7 R7-001):
- `actions/checkout@v4` defaults to fetch-depth: 1 in CI; that would render
  `git log -1` vacuous. This lint detects shallow clones and either fetches
  --unshallow against the default branch or hard-fails with a fix-it message.

Exit codes: 0 on pass, 1 on any failure (including shallow-clone refusal).
