"""Shared constants for v3.8 claim-faithfulness audit.

Single source of truth for the literals + regexes that appear in BOTH the
lint (`check_claim_audit_consistency.py`) and the pipeline runtime
(`claim_audit_pipeline.py`). Re-declaring these in both places opens a
drift hole — a spec bump that updates the lint without updating the
runtime would change one side silently. Tests cover both call sites; the
shared import binds them.

See docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-103-claim-alignment-audit-spec.md §3.1
(matrix + INV catalogue) and §4 step 3 (sampling) for canonical
