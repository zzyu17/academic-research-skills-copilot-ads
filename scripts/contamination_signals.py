"""#105 v3.7.3 contamination_signals resolvers.

Pure functions implementing v3.7.3 spec §3.2 Vector 1 + Vector 2 for use
by the migration tool. bibliography_agent computes these at ingest time;
this module gives the migration tool the equivalent computation for
post-hoc backfill on pre-v3.7.3 entries.

Design: docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-105-contamination-signals-backfill-design.md
Spec: docs/design/2026-05-12-ars-v3.7.3-claim-faithfulness-and-contaminated-source-spec.md §3.2

Omission reason-provenance (#511 Part A): wherever a resolver's contract below
says "caller MUST omit field" because of API DEGRADATION (an *Unavailable
exception), the caller additionally records the omission on the entry as
`contamination_signal_omissions: {<field>: "api_degraded"}` so a degraded
lookup stays distinguishable from "never computed". Derivable omissions are
NOT recorded (manual exemption ← obtained_via='manual'; arXiv skip ← absent
arxiv_id). Schema + mutual-exclusion rules:
shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json; registry row
`contamination_signal_api_degradation` in
shared/contracts/degradation_registry.json.
