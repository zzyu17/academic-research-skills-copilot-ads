"""Mutation tests for ARS v3.7.1 byte-equivalence SHA gate.

Spec: docs/design/2026-04-30-ars-v3.6.8-trust-provenance-and-drift-transparency-spec.md
      § Step 0 — Lint manifest separation (round-1 codex F-004 amend)

Tests verify that:
  1. Happy path: untouched v3.6.7 PATTERN PROTECTION blocks pass.
  2. Mutation: any byte change inside a v3.6.7-tagged block fails.
  3. Additive boundary: edits OUTSIDE v3.6.7-tagged blocks (e.g. appending
     a new "Two-Layer Citation Emission" section after the block) do NOT
     trigger SHA mismatch.
  4. v3.6.8 manifest shape validation (scope tag, files list).
  5. PR-1 expected state (v3.6.8 manifest with empty 'files' list) is OK.
  6. Boundary errors (v3.6.7 marker missing at HEAD; manifest absent).

The lint runs git operations against the actual repo, so each mutation
test backs up the file under test, mutates, runs the lint as a subprocess,
and restores the file in `finally` to keep the working tree clean.
