"""Defrift lock for the four #528 pipeline-boundary resolutions.

The 2026-07 Mode-A structural replay (#528) surfaced four inconsistencies /
under-specified boundaries across the academic-pipeline prompt surfaces.
PR #529 fixed the two genuine contradictions (items 1-2); the #528 closure PR
defined the two under-specified boundaries (items 3-4). None of the four had
a lint, so any future prompt edit could silently re-open them — the same
drift class the #491 lock closed for the Bucket A enforcement sentence.

Pinned invariants (one per replay item):

1. **Methodology Blueprint in the Stage 1→2 handoff** — all three handoff
   surfaces (SKILL.md Step 4 list, state-machine transition row, orchestrator
   handoff table) carry the Blueprint alongside RQ Brief / Bibliography /
   Synthesis.

2. **Stage 3' Minor does not trigger coaching** — the orchestrator's coaching
   trigger condition and Coaching Rules exclusion list both state it.

3. **Stage 5 boundary semantics** — the MANDATORY finalization boundary is the
   Stage 5 ENTRY gate (between Stage 4.5 PASS and the Stage 5 dispatch); the
   Stage 5 completion checkpoint is FULL — never SLIM. Authority section in
   the state machine + mirrored canonical fragments in SKILL.md and the
   orchestrator + the completion-checkpoint transition row.

4. **Stage 6 terminal semantics** — the state machine defines Stage 6, the
   decline path, the terminal checkpoint, and the acknowledgement vocabulary
   (finish / end / done / confirm + natural-language equivalent); SKILL.md,
   the orchestrator, and process_summary_protocol.md carry the vocabulary;
   the orchestrator wires the terminal state_tracker transition.

Falsifiability discipline (per feedback_lint_passes_but_prompt_silent.md):
the state-machine authority fragments are scoped to the § Stage 5 and Stage 6
Boundary Semantics H2 span via the shared `check_section_literals` — the same
fragment appearing elsewhere in the file does not count. The SKILL.md /
orchestrator mirror fragments are file-unique canonical sentences and are
deliberately pinned file-wide.

Exit codes: 0 on pass, 1 on any failure.

# Whole-file content locks (sha256) for ALL FIVE #528 pipeline surfaces.
#
# Twelve codex xhigh review rounds demonstrated that sentence-level pins on
# pipeline prompt surfaces cannot converge: every round found another single
# green mutation of an operative sentence, label, predicate, or enum value.
# So every surface this lint reads carries the bibliography_agent-style
# whole-file hash lock: ANY byte change fails CI until this constant is
# updated in the same commit — which is the review surface working as
# designed (the same F2-lock convention the repo already applies to
# bibliography_agent). The sentence pins above/below stay for targeted
# error messages; the hash is the catch-all that terminates the
# single-edit-mutation class by construction.
#
# Update procedure: edit the doc, run
#   python3 -c "import hashlib,pathlib;p='<path>';print(hashlib.sha256(pathlib.Path(p).read_bytes()).hexdigest())"
# and update the constant here IN THE SAME COMMIT, with the semantic change
# reviewed against the #528 resolutions.
