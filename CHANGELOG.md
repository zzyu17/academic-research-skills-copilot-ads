All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

**Bug fixes (no version bump — corrects a broken-on-arrival behavior from #190):**

- **#195 — `/ars-mark-read` crashed on real YAML passports.** `scripts/ars_mark_read.py:_load_corpus_keys` used `json.load()` to read the Material Passport, but every adapter (folder_scan / zotero / obsidian) and every other ARS tool produces / consumes `passport.yaml`. The existing 11-test fixture in `scripts/test_ars_mark_read.py` wrote JSON-formatted passports, so the suite was green while real-world `/ars-mark-read smith2024 --passport-path ./passport.yaml` exited with `json.JSONDecodeError` before reaching citation-key validation. Two new TDD tests pin the adapter-format expectation (YAML happy path + YAML invalid-key hard error); `_write_passport` helper switched to `yaml.safe_dump`. Companion P2 also closed: existing-but-unwritable read-log file now surfaces the canonical `[ARS-MARK-READ ERROR: ...]` fail-fast rather than a bare `PermissionError` traceback, via an extra `os.access(log_path, os.W_OK)` check after the parent-W_OK gate. 14 ars_mark_read tests pass (was 11), full suite 1623 / 3 skipped. Surfaced by post-squash codex review of PR #191 (issue #192).

**Plugin commands (prep for v3.10 — no behavior change to existing skills):**

- **#190 — `/ars-mark-read` + `/ars-unmark-read` plugin commands.** v3.6.8 spec §3.6 + Step 7 (round-2 R2-002, round-5 R5-003 amends) designed these commands as the user-facing affordance for the human-read signal, but the command surface itself was never shipped — `commands/` carried only the 10 `/ars-<mode>` skill triggers. New `scripts/ars_mark_read.py` deterministic CLI implements the four §3.6 R5-003 fail-fast modes (no active passport / passport not found / parent unreadable / read-log unwritable), the §3.6 firm-rule-2 hard error on invalid `citation_key`, batch-level all-or-nothing semantics (any invalid key rejects the whole batch), and the §3.6 firm-rule-3 append-only write to `<passport-stem>_human_read_log.yaml` next to the active Material Passport. `/ars-unmark-read` writes `rescinded_at: <ISO 8601>` to the matching entry, never deletes. Two new thin markdown command files (`commands/ars-mark-read.md`, `commands/ars-unmark-read.md`) invoke the CLI via Bash; both declare `model: sonnet` routing per `feedback_no_haiku.md`. New `scripts/check_v3_6_8_mark_read_commands.py` CI lint per spec Step 7 acceptance: 2 commands exist, carry the `literature_corpus[]` validation reference, reference the `human_read_log.yaml` peer-file write target (NOT entry frontmatter, per §3.1 firm rule 3), and declare `model: sonnet`. 11 unit tests for the CLI + 6 unit tests for the lint. `/ars-list-read` and `commands/ars-mark-read.zh-TW.md` were spec-marked optional and remain deferred. Closes #190.

**Localization (no version bump — no behavior change to skills):**

- **#185 — Simplified Chinese README.** New `README.zh-CN.md` (630 lines, mirroring `README.zh-TW.md` structure) translated by external contributor [@xpfo-go](https://github.com/xpfo-go) ([PR #181](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/pull/181)). Language switcher updated across the four READMEs (en / zh-CN / zh-TW / ja-JP); `CONTRIBUTING.md` README sync guidance extended to four locales. `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` refactored to share zh-TW / zh-CN logic via `ZH_README_CONFIGS` tuple; both locales covered by `test_aligned_zh_cn_readme_passes` + `test_stale_zh_cn_badge_fails` regression tests (symmetric with the ja-JP tests added in #170).

**CI / infrastructure (no version bump — no behavior change to skills):**

- **#156 — Unified pytest invocation manifest.** Twelve `pytest scripts/test_*.py` invocations in `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` are now declared in `scripts/_ci_pytest_manifest.toml` and run via `scripts/run_ci_pytest_manifest.py`. Drift guard `scripts/check_ci_pytest_manifest.py` rejects (a) missing `path`, (b) duplicate `id`, (c) duplicate `(path, args)`, (d) malformed `args`, (e) any `pytest scripts/test_*.py` re-introduced in the workflow outside the runner. `pip install pytest` consolidates from 12 redundant installs to one. 17 unit tests for runner + lint. `python3 -m unittest scripts.test_*` invocations stay inline (out of scope for #156). 41 disk `test_*.py` files that the manifest does not list remain unclassified — separate follow-up.

- **#155 — Re-attempt F4: harden `test-count-monotonic.yml` to fail on pytest collection errors.** Both head and base count steps now capture pytest's exit code separately from the pipe, treat exit 5 (no tests collected) as a tolerable degenerate case, and fail the gate on any other non-zero exit. Previously, a `2>/dev/null | grep -c '::' || true` swallow on the base step would silently set BASE_COUNT to 0 on a broken-import or fixture-missing error in the base commit, making the head-vs-base monotonic check vacuously pass. The original F4 fix landed in PR #153 commit 8121dfa during the v3.9.4.2 cycle but was reverted in 4abf9de when it surfaced #154 (now closed by PR #158). With #154 fixed and #156 keeping CI test discovery clean, F4 v2 ships symmetrically across head and base.

## [3.9.4.2] - 2026-05-19 — Post-ship hotfix for PR #149 CI discipline gates

**Trigger:** Codex post-ship review of PR #149 (7 CI discipline gates mechanizing the release-cycle review chain) surfaced 4 P2 findings. v3.9.4.2 hardens 3 of 4; the 4th (test-count-monotonic harden) was reverted because it surfaced a pre-existing `scripts/` package issue, tracked as #154 (since fixed by PR #158) and re-attempt #155.

**CI gate hardening (PR #149 + #153):**
- **F1 — harness-retirement scheduler context:** `harness-retirement-monthly.yml` adds `GH_REPO` so scheduled runs have repo context for `gh issue create` (workflow was silently failing on cron without it).
- **F2 — release-cooldown tag filter:** `release-cooldown.yml` filters `PREV_TAG` lookup to `v*` tags so non-release tags (e.g., legacy plugin tags) cannot bypass the cooldown gate.
- **F3 — release-cooldown hot-fix detection:** `release-cooldown.yml` also reads annotated tag subject + accepts the `hot-fix` spelling variant; v3.9.2 was previously a false-negative hotfix under the old detector.
- **F4 (reverted):** `test-count-monotonic.yml` harden landed in 8121dfa and reverted in 4abf9de when it surfaced `scripts/` package import errors (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'`) — pre-existing latent defect masked by the prior `2>/dev/null | || true` pattern. Tracked as #154 (now closed by PR #158) and re-attempt #155.

**Release-cooldown symmetry follow-up (PR #157):**
- Override token `[skip-cooldown]` now read from both the commit message AND the annotated tag message. This v3.9.4.2 tag itself is the self-bootstrapping fix — the gate correctly identified v3.9.4.1 (3h prior) as the previous hotfix and fired the 24h cooldown, proving F2+F3 work end-to-end. The override symmetry patch makes the tag shippable.

**Closes:** #152. **Follow-ups:** #154 (closed by PR #158), #155, #156.

## [3.9.4.1] - 2026-05-19 — Post-ship hotfix for v3.9.4 temporal verification

**Trigger:** Codex post-ship review of v3.9.4 squash commit `af09cf5` surfaced 4 real bugs that per-task subagent reviewers missed during v3.9.4 implementation. v3.9.4 tag remains immutable; v3.9.4.1 patches the verifier and schema layer + brings docs in alignment.

**Bug fixes:**
- **#135 P1 (audit wiring):** `audit()` now passes `citation_provenance` through to `_pass_2_anachronism` and `_pass_4_causal`. When a ref slug has `confidence: low` or `conflict` in citation_provenance.yaml, the verifier emits `TEMPORAL-METADATA-MISSING` instead of using timeline dates as arithmetic ground truth. v3.9.4 dropped citation_provenance on the floor — spec §3.4 first-party safety check was structurally broken.
- **#135 P1 (date parser):** `_date_to_interval()` now parses all schema-valid date shapes including `YYYY-MM` (Crossref month-precision output) and `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD` (interval precision used by effective_date_range). v3.9.4 only handled day/year/prose-month forms — schema-valid month/interval shapes raised ValueError and P2/P4 silently skipped the check via the existing `except ValueError: continue` guard.
- **#135 P2 (P4 direct-date binding):** P4 now binds each side of a causal trigger to either a `<!--ref:slug-->` marker OR a direct date capture in the sentence. v3.9.4 required refs on both sides, silently dropping sentences like "The 2026 policy enabled the 2020 rollout." `bound_dates.source` distinguishes `timeline_ref` from `draft_capture`; `bound_refs` is empty when both sides came from direct date capture.
- **#135 P2 (schema absent-property bypass):** `citation_provenance.schema.json` `confidence:high` allOf branch now requires both `crossref_issued` and `pdftotext_cover_first_line` to be present in addition to non-null (`then.required` added). v3.9.4 used `then.properties` only, which doesn't fire when a property is absent — so entries with `confidence:high` and both source fields omitted silently passed validation.

**Documentation:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated from stale v3.8.0 baseline to v3.9.4.1; Section 8 Evolution Timeline filled in v3.8.1 / v3.8.2 / v3.9.0 / v3.9.1 / v3.9.2 / v3.9.3 / v3.9.4 / v3.9.4.1 entries; Section 9 Skill Modes table aligned to current versions.
- Suite-version needles aligned across MODE_REGISTRY.md, README.md badge + tag URL + section heading, README.zh-TW.md badge + tag URL + section heading, academic-pipeline/SKILL.md frontmatter, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` expected-text constants, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` skill suite table.

**Test count:** 1549 → **1561** (+12 net new tests covering all 4 fixes, 0 regression).

---

## [3.9.4] - 2026-05-18 — Temporal Verification Layer (advisory)

**External motivation:** Issue #135 — LLM next-token objectives are systematically blind to deterministic factual classes including temporal ordering. v3.9.4 adds a deterministic advisory verifier at the Phase 4 → 5 boundary covering 5 failure modes.

**Mechanisms:**
- M1: new Phase 2 sibling `timeline_extraction_agent` owning `phase2_investigation/timeline.yaml` + `phase2_investigation/citation_provenance.yaml`
- M2: Phase 4 → 5 deterministic verifier `scripts/temporal_integrity_audit.py` (5 passes)
- M3: Temporal Integrity Iron Rule in `report_compiler_agent` + `draft_writer_agent`
- M6-minimal: First-party Crossref `issued` + pdftotext cover verification
- M7-minimal: Date provenance + comparator materialization
- M5-stub: User-declared `version_family_id` only

**Zero modification** to `literature_corpus_entry`, `claim_audit_result`, `claim_intent_manifest`. `bibliography_agent` unmodified (F2 invariant). 3 new sidecar schemas (aggregate-level with `$defs`).

**Coverage estimate:** 55-70% baseline / 65-75% with M7 minimal (LLM extractor blindness on tuple extraction is structural; advisory architecture acknowledges this).

**Out of v3.9.4 scope** (deferred to v3.10): M4 reviewer integration, M5 full version discovery, M6 full PDF audit, M8 relation manifest, CC5 catalog-completeness semantics, hard-block policy, OpenAlex lookup.

Spec: `docs/design/2026-05-18-ars-v3.9.4-temporal-verification-spec.md`.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-05-18 — Housekeeping (#128 §1-3, §5-6)

Pure refactor + one latent-bug fix carrying over from the v3.9.0 `/simplify` review backlog. The v3.9.0 cross-index triangulation client family (Semantic Scholar + OpenAlex + Crossref) shipped intentionally byte-equivalent across 3 client modules for code locality; now that the family is stable, the dedup prevents sibling drift when threshold tuning, normalization rules, or throttle measurement need adjustment.

### Refactor — extracted helpers (no behavior change)

- **`scripts/_text_similarity.py`** — extracts 4 helpers + 4 constants previously triple-implemented byte-equivalent in `semantic_scholar_client.py` / `openalex_client.py` / `crossref_client.py`: `_PUNCT_TRANSLATION`, `_normalize_title`, `_similarity`, `_TITLE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.70`, `_BACKOFF_SECONDS = 2.0`, `_MAX_RETRIES = 3`. 14 new tests on the shared module.
- **`scripts/_passport_yaml.py`** — extracts ruamel.yaml round-trip config (`preserve_quotes = True`, `indent(mapping=2, sequence=4, offset=2)`) + `load_passport` / `dump_passport` functions previously duplicated byte-equivalent in `migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py` + `migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_9_0.py`. 7 new tests on the shared module.
- **`contamination_signals._resolve_by_doi_then_title`** — private helper for the identical DOI-then-title control flow shared by `resolve_openalex_unmatched` (§3.4) + `resolve_crossref_unmatched` (§3.5). Both public wrappers preserve the v3.9.0 spec API surface; exception-type differentiation stays at the wrapper. 10 existing resolver tests verify byte-equivalent behavior.

### Latent-bug fix — throttle measurement standardized on `time.monotonic`

- OpenAlex + Crossref clients now use `time.monotonic()` for `_throttle()` elapsed measurement + `_last_request_at` anchor refresh, matching Semantic Scholar (which had standardized on monotonic per #115 R5-2). NTP / manual clock adjustments could push `time.time()` backward, producing negative elapsed and either inflated sleep (negative compared less than min_interval) or zero sleep — latent throttle-bypass / API-spam bug. Documented as a "maintenance smell" in #128 §6.
- New tests (`test_openalex_client::test_throttle_uses_monotonic_clock` + `test_crossref_client::test_throttle_uses_monotonic_clock`) lock NTP-safe semantics: throttle reads `time.monotonic` and never reads `time.time`.

### Dual-path import infrastructure

- All 5 module-level cross-imports in `openalex_client.py` / `crossref_client.py` / `semantic_scholar_client.py` / `migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py` / `migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_9_0.py` use the dual-path try/except pattern (sibling-first, namespace-package fallback). Follows `scripts/slr_lineage.py` precedent but inverted for class-identity preservation (pytest uses sibling-path imports; `SemanticScholarUnavailable` from `scripts.contamination_signals` is a different class instance than `contamination_signals.SemanticScholarUnavailable`).
- Latent fix: `scripts.semantic_scholar_client` + `scripts.migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3` are now `import scripts.X`-clean from repo root (were silently broken on main due to pre-existing absolute cross-imports). Caught by codex round-1 reasoning trace.

### Deferred from #128

- **§4 — parallelize OA + CR per-entry calls in v3.9.0 migration tool** carried to #138 (target v3.9.4 or v3.10). Introduces new behavior + ThreadPoolExecutor + test-rebuild scope; incompatible with v3.9.3 patch boundary.

### Regression status

- 1482 → **1505 passed** + 3 skipped + 111 subtests (+23 new tests, 0 regression).
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` + `scripts/check_version_consistency.py` green.
- 6/6 `import scripts.X` paths verified clean from repo root (3 from-OK-to-OK, 2 latent-broken-now-OK, 1 OK throughout).
- Cross-model review: codex round 1 + 2 both 0 explicit findings (one P1 self-caught from R1 trace, closed pre-R2). Gemini 3.1-pro-preview round 1: 0 findings.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-05-18 — Phase boundary hot-fix (#133)

Hot-fix for issue #133 (phase scope inflation). A user incident showed that ARS auto-dispatched a single-phase agent (`bibliography_agent`) when given ambiguous cross-phase input (pre-written abstract + pre-collected literature), and the dispatched agent then autonomously executed Phases 3-6, skipping mandatory independent crosschecks (DA / EIC / Ethics).

This release ships the prompt-discipline + advisory-verifier hot-fix. The deterministic gate (PreToolUse hook + multi-phase task envelope schema + author provenance) is tracked separately as **v3.10 active conductor (#134)** — long-term architectural fix.

Design history: 4 design rounds (v1-v4) + mid-impl review. Triple-track reviewer use cases (codex `review --base main` + inline opus subagent + self-review). Codex 0.130 broke on this repo context 5x consecutive per memory `feedback_codex_0_130_docs_review_broken.md` (49 files / 1529 lines on full branch is firmly in the broken corner); inline opus was the substantive reviewer throughout. Net effect: design has been challenged thoroughly; honest framing applied where prompt-only mitigation is known insufficient.

### Added

- **Routing Discipline (Phase L1)** — `.claude/CLAUDE.md` gains a new "Routing Discipline (v3.9.2)" section before existing Routing Rules 1-5. 3 routing classes: explicit intent → proceed directly; cross-phase materials → clarify with a-d options; no-materials ambiguous → clarify. `[direct-mode]` byte-0 escape hatch (case-insensitive; bracket-form strict). Anti-pattern explicitly named.
- **Intent clarification protocol** — new `shared/references/intent_clarification_protocol.md` (~200 lines): trigger condition table, pipeline phase reference (Phase 0-7 marker conventions), clarification message template (a-d options, no AskUserQuestion tool), `[direct-mode]` mechanism spec with 5 worked examples, v3.10 carry-over notes.
- **Phase Boundary block on 22 Bucket A agents (Phase 1)** — single-phase agents (deep-research × 9, academic-paper × 7, academic-paper-reviewer × 6) gain a `## Phase Boundary (v3.9.2)` block customized per agent: phase number, deliverable type, MUST-NOT cross-phase writes, MAY-READ upstream context (Phase 5 reviewers granted explicit cross-phase READ for review), explicit coexistence with skill-specific protocols (v3.6.2 / v3.6.5 / v3.6.6 / v3.6.7 / v3.7.1). 16 Bucket B/C/D agents (multi-phase / phase-orthogonal / cross-phase-meta) intentionally NOT fenced — honest framing per opus HIGH-2 (placebo prose creates false-enforcement illusion).
- **Phase-by-phase invocation contract (Phase 3)** — 4 SKILL.md files gain a "Phase-by-phase Invocation Contract (v3.9.2)" section: Mode A (orchestrator-driven, default) vs Mode B (phase-by-phase cross-session resume), Bucket A enforcement scope, coexistence with skill-specific protocols.
- **Advisory verifier (Phase 4)** — new `scripts/check_pipeline_integrity.py`: scans working directory for `phaseN_*/` (N=1-6), flags STRUCTURAL finding when phase5 dir lacks DA/EIC/Ethics filenames (the #133 pattern). HEURISTIC adjacent-phase-mtime rule (`--strict`, default OFF). Cross-platform, user-invokable, advisory output (exit 0 on findings), JSON + text output modes. Normative filename convention documented; v3.10 envelope provenance replaces filename matching.
- **Phase Boundary coverage lint (Phase 5)** — new `scripts/check_v3_9_2_phase_boundary.py`: enforces 22 Bucket A agents have block, 16 Bucket B/C/D agents don't, and each Bucket A block contains 4 load-bearing phrases (Phase Boundary v3.9.2, MUST NOT, MAY READ, Enforcement v3.9.2). Wired to `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`.
- **Classification spec** — new `docs/design/2026-05-18-ars-v3.9.2-agent-phase-classification.md`: canonical 38-agent table with 4-bucket model (A=22, B=4, C=8, D=4) + per-agent out-of-scope inflation risk column.
- **8 behavioral smoke test fixtures** — `tests/fixtures/issue_133_routing/`: cross-phase abstract+lit (the #133 root case), single-phase explicit, no-materials ambiguous, /ars-slash command, `[direct-mode]` byte-0 honored, mid-message NOT honored, case-insensitive accepted, full draft+abstract+lit+reviews. Honestly framed as LLM-behavior assertions with cross-model spot-check criterion (100% Opus 4.7, ≥75% Sonnet 4.6 + GPT-5.5).
- **Plugin metadata bump** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version 3.8.2 → 3.9.2 (was stale; also catches v3.9.0 + v3.9.1 deferrals); description updated for 38-agent ensemble and v3.9.2 phase boundary feature.

### Fixed

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md` Suite version was stale at 3.9.0** — v3.9.1 ship missed bumping it (latent lint bug surfaced during v3.9.2 work). v3.9.2 atomic bump fixes this.

### Tests

- 12 new tests in `scripts/test_check_pipeline_integrity.py` (verifier).
- 3 new tests in `scripts/test_check_v3_9_2_phase_boundary.py` (boundary coverage lint).
- 4 additional tests after Phase 6 mid-impl review absorption (dotfiles ignored, multiple phase5 dirs independent, Unicode stem matching, nested subdir recursion).
- Regression baseline: 1463 → 1482 passed (+19); 3 skipped + 111 subtests unchanged; 0 failures.

### Out of scope (carry to v3.10 conductor, issue #134)

- PreToolUse hook (Phase 0.1 verified Claude Code payload includes `agent_type` field; hook implementation requires multi-phase schema first — both deferred to v3.10).
- Multi-phase `ars_phase_writes` + `ars_phase_reads` envelope schema (scalar `ars_phase` cannot represent agents like `devils_advocate_agent` at Phases 1/3/5 or `report_compiler_agent` at Phases 4/6 — design correctly with envelope, not retrofit scalar).
- Deterministic verifier with author provenance (advisory v3.9.2 filename-heuristic version flagged FP-prone in docstring).
- Orchestrator cross-phase intake capability (`pipeline_orchestrator_agent` currently keyword-matches user phrasing; cannot reconcile cross-phase artifacts without explicit user signal — this is the conductor's core feature).

### Migration notes

Existing in-flight projects: no break expected. v3.9.2 only adds prompt sections and an opt-in advisory verifier. Existing slash commands (`/ars-*`) continue to work without change.

User-facing behavior change: if you previously dropped pre-existing materials (abstract + literature) into a fresh session without invoking a specific slash command, ARS may now clarify with a-d options instead of silent dispatch. To bypass clarification for direct agent dispatch, prefix your first message with `[direct-mode]`. To run the full pipeline on pre-existing materials, invoke `/ars-full`.

If you see a Bucket B multi-phase agent (devils_advocate, report_compiler, argument_builder, visualization) producing out-of-scope content, this is a known v3.9.2 limitation — recurrence is expected for these 4 agents until v3.10 envelope ships. Remediation: switch to orchestrator-driven Mode A via `/ars-full` or report the case to issue #134 with transcript excerpt.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-05-18 — v3.9.0 client hardening (#129 + #130)

Two-bug hotfix surfaced by codex review of `ars-codex` PR #13 (vendor sync to v3.9.0 `74413a4`). Both bugs exist in v3.9.0 main: #129 violates the v3.9.0 §3.7 per-API degradation contract; #130 crashes a defensive lint on malformed input. Neither changes the spec or schema.

### Fixed

- **#129 — OpenAlex / Crossref response-read failures now translate to `*Unavailable`.** In `scripts/openalex_client.py:_get` and `scripts/crossref_client.py:_get`, `urlopen` succeeded but `resp.read()` / `body.decode("utf-8")` / `json.loads()` failures (socket drop mid-stream, truncated body, garbled UTF-8 body, HTML 503 page returned with 200 status) escaped the client as raw `OSError` / `http.client.IncompleteRead` / `UnicodeDecodeError` / `JSONDecodeError`. `scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_9_0.py` only catches `OpenAlexUnavailable` / `CrossrefUnavailable`, so one transient response failure during a 500-entry backfill aborted the whole migration instead of dropping just the affected field. Narrow except block around read+decode+parse now catches `(OSError, http.client.HTTPException, UnicodeDecodeError, json.JSONDecodeError)` — `HTTPException` covers `IncompleteRead` (canonical mid-stream socket drop, inherits HTTPException not OSError, R1 codex P2 closure). Mirrors the existing 5xx-skip pattern: per-API tolerant per the v3.9.0 spec §3.7 documented degradation contract and `bibliography_agent.md` "Triangulation Extension".

- **#130 — `check_claim_audit_consistency` non-string `manifest_id` guard.** `_build_manifest_index` (line 644) and `_build_manifest_constraint_index` (line 675) used `manifest_id` as a dict key via `setdefault(mid, set())` / `out[mid] = bucket` before checking type. For malformed passports where the schema validator already noted `manifest_id` as `array` / `object`, the index builder raised `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` and terminated lint with a traceback before `validate_passport()` could return the schema finding cleanly. Added `isinstance(mid, str) and mid` guard at both sites, matching the surrounding `_check_inv_17_for_manifest` / `claim_id` invariant-walker pattern. Schema validator still records the type mismatch — the guard just lets the lint surface findings cleanly instead of crashing.

### Tests

- `scripts/test_openalex_client.py`: +4 tests covering OSError on `resp.read()`, invalid UTF-8 body, invalid JSON body, and `http.client.IncompleteRead` (R1 codex P2 closure).
- `scripts/test_crossref_client.py`: +4 symmetric tests.
- `scripts/test_claim_audit_schema.py`: new `TSManifestIdNonStringGuard` class with 2 tests (`manifest_id` as list / dict).
- Regression baseline: 1453 → 1463 passed (+10), 3 skipped + 111 subtests unchanged, 0 failures.

### Out of scope

- Spec / schema / CHANGELOG narrative not touched — the degradation contract is already documented in spec §3.7; this just makes code honor it.
- `ars-codex` adapter sibling: the same two fixes will surface on next vendor sync (v3.9.1 → ars-codex v0.1.8). No action needed in this release.

---

## [3.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Cross-index triangulation as v3.7.3 contamination_signals Vector 3 (issue #102). Two new optional boolean fields (`openalex_unmatched`, `crossref_unmatched`) inside `literature_corpus_entry.schema.json`. Manual-entry not-rule extended symmetrically to forbid all three lookup fields (preprint flag remains exempt — heuristic, not lookup).
- OpenAlex API protocol (`deep-research/references/openalex_api_protocol.md`) + production client (`scripts/openalex_client.py`).
- Crossref API protocol (`deep-research/references/crossref_api_protocol.md`) + production client (`scripts/crossref_client.py`).
- `bibliography_agent.md` Triangulation Extension subsection — parallel S2/OpenAlex/Crossref lookups, per-API degradation, manual exemption, R-L3-2-D constraint, per-entry ingest log format.
- Finalizer 4-tier advisory annotation in `pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md`: k=1 → `CONTAMINATED-COVERAGE-NOISE` (or legacy `CONTAMINATED-UNMATCHED` for k_max=1 S2-only), k=2 → `CONTAMINATED-PARTIAL-UNMATCH`, k=3 → `CONTAMINATED-TRIANGULATION-UNMATCHED`. All tiers advisory; gate refusal list unchanged.
- `formatter_agent.md` pass-through allowlist extends from 3 v3.7.3 suffixes to 9 (3 legacy + 6 v3.9.0). Refusal rules 1-10 unchanged.
- v3.9.0 lint (`scripts/check_v3_9_0_triangulation.py`): set-equality on formatter allowlist, refusal-list-unchanged guard. Exact-token extraction prevents substring collisions (R3 P2 closure).
- Migration tool (`scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_9_0.py`): backfill v3.7.3 → v3.9.0; stable-fields idempotency; per-API degradation tolerant; dry-run mode; daisy-chained migration scope (pre-v3.7.3 entries require v3.7.3 migration first).
- 3 new firm rules in spec §3.3: R-L3-2-C (k computed over present fields, absent ≠ false), R-L3-2-D (no OpenAlex `primary_location.source.type` / Crossref `type` used for v3.9.0 classification logic), R-L3-2-E (refusal list unchanged; pass-through allowlist extends).

### Design philosophy
- v3.9.0 is the **measurement layer** for cross-index triangulation. The **policy layer** (strict modes, hard-block tier, venue-type-scoped strict, `triangulation_policy` field, `venue_type` field) is deferred to v3.10 per spec §2.3.
- The k=3 marker is `CONTAMINATED-TRIANGULATION-UNMATCHED` (describes observable condition), not `CONTAMINATED-LIKELY-FABRICATED` (would infer cause unsupportable on humanities / non-English / dissertation references where coverage gaps are real).
- R-L3-2-A preserved verbatim: contamination signals never block emission on their own.

### Migration path
- v3.7.3 corpora: run `python scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_9_0.py PATH` to backfill the two new fields.
- Pre-v3.7.3 corpora: run `python scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py PATH` FIRST, then v3.9.0 migration (daisy-chained per spec §3.7).

### Review trail
- R1 (commit `d9280bf`): 15 findings (3 P0, 8 P1, 4 P2) — closed.
- R2 (commit `7d51215`): 12 findings (0 P0, 3 P1, 9 P2) — closed.
- R3 (commit `4297c27`): 4 P2 findings — closed in Task 1 of impl plan.
- Both tracks (codex gpt-5.5 xhigh + Gemini 3.1-pro-preview) READY-FOR-IMPL after R3.

## [3.8.2] - 2026-05-17 — #118 uncited audit_tool_failure surface

Fixes the #118 carry-over from #103 R3 codex P2 #5. The `ARS_CLAIM_AUDIT=1` uncited constraint-judging path used to silently substitute `{"judgment": "NOT_VIOLATED", "rationale": "..."}` on `JudgeInvocationError`, suppressing HIGH-WARN constraint checks on transient judge outage (judge timeout, API 5xx, network error, etc.). v3.8.2 routes those failures through a dedicated `uncited_audit_failures[]` aggregate at MED-WARN advisory tier, mirroring INV-14 semantics on the cited path but using a separate schema because `claim_audit_result.ref_slug` is required and the uncited path has no ref to bind.

The #118 issue body listed four candidate options. Option 1 (extend `constraint_violation.schema.json`) would have broken the `judge_verdict: const VIOLATED` invariant and re-derived every CV-INV. Option 3 (overload `uncited_assertions[]` with a `fault_class` field) would have polluted the D4-c LOW-WARN advisory channel with audit-time infrastructure signal. Option 4 (re-raise `JudgeInvocationError` and abort the audit pass) would have dropped audit coverage for the entire run on a single transient outage — bad UX for N>50 papers running against flaky judge endpoints. Option 2 (new aggregate) ships here: structural honesty, schema integrity preserved, audit coverage preserved.

### Added

- **`shared/contracts/passport/uncited_audit_failure.schema.json`** — new aggregate per spec §3.6. Required fields: `finding_id` (`UAF-NNN`), `claim_text`, `section_path`, `scoped_manifest_id`, `fault_class` (closed enum mirroring INV-14), `rationale` (MUST begin with fault_class prefix), `judge_model`, `judge_run_at`, `rule_version: D4-c-v1-uaf-v1`. Optional `manifest_claim_id` (non-null when failure was against an NC-C claim-level constraint, null when against MNCs only).
- **UAF-INV-1..UAF-INV-6** lint coverage in `scripts/check_claim_audit_consistency.py` rule 4d:
  - UAF-INV-1: finding_id uniqueness across the aggregate
  - UAF-INV-2: scoped_manifest_id cross-array integrity
  - UAF-INV-3: (scoped_manifest_id, manifest_claim_id) pair integrity when manifest_claim_id non-null
  - UAF-INV-4: per-(sentence, manifest) dedup with key `(scoped_manifest_id, section_path, claim_text_hash)`
  - UAF-INV-5: rationale fault_class prefix matches the row's own `fault_class` field
  - UAF-INV-6: cross-aggregate exclusivity vs `constraint_violations[]` (VIOLATED and audit_tool_failure are mutually exclusive verdict states at per-(sentence, manifest) level)
- **Finalizer §5 MED-WARN advisory row**: annotation `[CLAIM-AUDIT-TOOL-FAILURE-UNCITED — <fault-class>]` next to the offending sentence. Always advisory; gate passes — retry on next pipeline pass is the remediation. Formatter REFUSE list unchanged (UAF is advisory, not gate-refuse).
- **`UAF_RULE_VERSION = "D4-c-v1-uaf-v1"`** constant in `scripts/_claim_audit_constants.py` for shared use by pipeline runtime and lint.
- **18 new tests** keeping the regression baseline 0 (694 → 712 tests):
  - 15 schema + lint tests in `scripts/test_claim_audit_schema.py::TSUAFUncitedAuditFailureInvariants`
  - 3 pipeline integration tests in `scripts/test_claim_audit_pipeline.py::TP23UncitedJudgeOutageEmitsUAF` proving the swallow is replaced with UAF emit and no synthetic NOT_VIOLATED leaks into any aggregate

### Changed

- **`scripts/claim_audit_pipeline.py`**: swallow site at line 1211-1224 (the synthetic `NOT_VIOLATED` substitution) replaced with `_uncited_audit_failure_entry(...)` emission + `continue`. Pipeline return now includes `uncited_audit_failures` alongside the other five aggregates.
- **`docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-103-claim-alignment-audit-spec.md`**: amended with new §3.6 (schema + UAF-INV-1..6 + co-emission rules), §4 step 5 stream (d) routing clause, §4 step 9 fourth error-handling bullet, §5 finalizer outputs list + advisory paragraph, §6 lint rule 4d + precedence rule 6 cross-aggregate exclusivity reference.
- **`academic-pipeline/agents/claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent.md`**: Output emission table grows seventh row for `uncited_audit_failures[]`. Error handling table grows from 3 failure surfaces to 4 (the new uncited-path UAF row mirrors the cited-path `audit_tool_failure` row).

### Fixed

- **#118**: uncited judge failure no longer swallowed as NOT_VIOLATED; the HIGH-WARN constraint check path is now observable on transient outage. Pre-v3.8.2 a flaky judge endpoint could silently pass a draft with a real MUST-NOT violation; v3.8.2 surfaces the operational failure at MED-WARN advisory tier so a retry pass picks it up.

### Review trail

Single-PR ship after spec → TDD → impl. UAF schema design followed the design-phase brainstorming rule per `feedback_dual_track_design_phase_review_workflow.md`: option 1-4 trade-off analysis happened in conversation with the user before any code, decision memo in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-issue-118-uncited-audit-tool-failure-design.md` (local, gitignored). Implementation followed strict TDD RED → GREEN — 15 schema/lint tests + 3 pipeline tests all failed in their intended way (no schema file, no lint logic, swallow site still active) before the schema, lint, helper, and pipeline change landed. No regression on the 694 pre-existing tests.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-05-17 — claim_audit lint hardening (#119 + #120 4×P2 closure)

Defense-in-depth patch on `ARS_CLAIM_AUDIT=1` opt-in lint paths. Five fixes carried over from #103 R6 + R8 codex review, consolidated into one v3.8.1 release. No schema semantic change, no behavior change for well-formed payloads — pre-fix surfaces all crashed the CLI with `TypeError` / `AttributeError` instead of returning actionable lint findings or routing through the INV-14 `audit_tool_failure` translation boundary.

### Fixed

- **#119 / #120 P2-2 — nested schema-invalid shapes no longer crash invariant walkers.** Added `_iter_dicts` helper and narrow `isinstance(str)` guards in `_check_inv_17_for_manifest`, `_check_manifest_invariants`, `_build_manifest_index`, `_build_manifest_constraint_index` so that nested `claim_intent_manifests[].claims` as string, `claims[].claim_id` non-string, or `audit_sampling_summaries[].audited_indices` mixed types now surface as clean schema findings instead of crashing on `for claim in "broken":`, regex against non-string, or `int <= str` comparison. The schema validator still records the type mismatch separately — narrow walker guards prevent the second-stage crash without masking schema-vs-invariant double coverage (option 2 refined, not aggregate-level skip).
- **#120 P2-1 — CV-INV-4 dedupe scoped by `scoped_manifest_id`.** Dedupe key extended from `(section_path, claim_text_hash, violated_constraint_id)` to `(scoped_manifest_id, section_path, claim_text_hash, violated_constraint_id)`. Per M-INV-4, `manifest_id` is unique across the passport but constraint ids (`MNC-*` / `NC-*`) are only unique WITHIN a manifest — two manifests in the same passport may legitimately carry colliding constraint ids, and the same sentence may then violate both. Pre-fix, the dedupe false-positived these as duplicates. Spec wording in §3.5 + §7.1 4b updated.
- **#120 P2-3 — judge `judgment` `isinstance(str)` guard before set membership.** `_validate_judge_dict` now rejects a non-string judgment (e.g. malformed `{"judgment": [1, 2], "rationale": "..."}`) as `judge_parse_error → audit_tool_failure` via the INV-14 translation boundary instead of bubbling `TypeError("unhashable type: 'list'")` out of the set-membership test.
- **#120 P2-4 — retrieve `ref_retrieval_method` `isinstance(str)` guard before set membership.** Symmetric to P2-3 on the retrieval boundary. `_invoke_retrieve` rejects a non-string method as `retrieval_api_error → audit_tool_failure` instead of crashing on set membership.

### Tests

- `scripts/test_claim_audit_schema.py`: 3 new tests in `TS9MalformedPassportGuard` (nested string / non-string claim_id / mixed-type indices) + new test class `TSCVDedupeManifestScope` with 2 tests (cross-manifest collision must keep both; within-manifest true duplicate still caught).
- `scripts/test_claim_audit_pipeline.py`: 2 new tests in `TP12JudgeFailureAuditToolFailure` (non-string list + dict judgment) + 1 new test in `TP14RetrieveFailureAuditToolFailure` (non-string list method).
- Regression baseline: 682 → 690 tests (+8), 0 failures, 0 errors across full `scripts/test_*.py` discovery.

### Design memo

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-v3.8.1-claim-audit-lint-hardening.md` (local; gitignored per ARS personal-workspace convention) carries the option-1 vs option-2 analysis, CV-INV-4 dedupe key shape rationale, and the release-framing decision.

Closes [#119](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/119). Refs [#120](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/120) P2-1, P2-2, P2-3, P2-4 (all four R8 findings).

## [3.8.0] - 2026-05-16 — L3 Claim-Faithfulness Locator + Audit (v3.7.3 + #103 paired milestone)

v3.7.3 + v3.8 close the L3 (claim-faithfulness) gap end-to-end. v3.7.3 ships the locator infrastructure (every citation carries a three-layer anchor so the audit can fetch the cited passage); v3.8 ships the audit pass that consumes those anchors, judges whether the cited source supports the claim, and gate-refuses HIGH-WARN violations at the formatter terminal hard gate. The release also bundles 5 audit-trail-shipped feature PRs accumulated on main since v3.7.0 (#104 / #105 / #108 / #111 / #115). External motivation: Zhao et al. arXiv:2605.07723 (2026-05) — 146,932 hallucinated citations across arXiv / bioRxiv / SSRN / PMC in 2025.

### #103 — v3.8 claim ↔ reference faithfulness audit agent (2026-05-16)

**Parent issue:** [#103](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/103) — closes the L3 (claim-faithfulness) gap left open by v3.7.3 (which closed the locator-channel half). Spec: `docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-103-claim-alignment-audit-spec.md` + decision doc `docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-103-claim-alignment-audit-decision.md` (D1-D6 settled).

**Why:** Zhao et al. arXiv:2605.07723 (2026-05) shows 146,932 hallucinated citations across arXiv / bioRxiv / SSRN / PMC in 2025; v3.7.3 stopped the "no locator" path but a present-but-wrong claim ↔ source mismatch was still undetected. v3.8 adds a Stage 4→5 audit pass that judges every sampled citation against its retrieved excerpt, emits 5 new passport aggregates, and drives 5 new HIGH-WARN annotation classes through the formatter terminal hard gate.

**New components:**

- **`claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent`** (1 new agent, `academic-pipeline/agents/`) — opt-in (`ARS_CLAIM_AUDIT=1`, default OFF for v3.8.0) audit agent dispatched between v3.7.1 cite finalizer and formatter hard gate. Takes citations + manifests + corpus + Stage 4 draft sentence stream (full uncited + D4-c filtered subset).
- **5 new passport schemas** (`shared/contracts/passport/`): `claim_audit_result`, `claim_intent_manifest`, `claim_drift`, `uncited_assertion`, `constraint_violation`. Cross-field invariants INV-1..INV-18 / M-INV-1..M-INV-4 / U-INV-1..U-INV-4 / D-INV-1..D-INV-4 / CV-INV-1..CV-INV-4 lint-enforced (JSON Schema can't express the conditional matrix relating judgment / audit_status / defect_stage / ref_retrieval_method).
- **Runtime pipeline** (`scripts/claim_audit_pipeline.py`) — implements §4 step 1-6 + manifest set-diff (D6 set-of-text semantics). Per-citation judge wrapping (`_invoke_judge` + `_invoke_retrieve` translate transient failures to INV-14 `audit_tool_failure` rows: judge_timeout / judge_api_error / judge_parse_error / cache_corruption / retrieval_api_error / retrieval_timeout / retrieval_network_error). Cache hits re-validated through the same surface. Per-manifest uncited judge calls to prevent MNC id collisions across manifests.
- **8-row finalizer matrix** (`scripts/claim_audit_finalizer.py`) — discriminates paywall (LOW-WARN advisory) / fabricated reference (HIGH-WARN gate-refuse) / anchorless (HIGH-WARN defense-in-depth) / audit_tool_failure (MED-WARN advisory) via `ref_retrieval_method` alongside `(judgment, defect_stage)`.
- **5 new HIGH-WARN annotation classes** in `formatter_agent` REFUSE list: `[HIGH-WARN-CLAIM-NOT-SUPPORTED]` / `[HIGH-WARN-NEGATIVE-CONSTRAINT-VIOLATION]` / `[HIGH-WARN-FABRICATED-REFERENCE]` / `[HIGH-WARN-CLAIM-AUDIT-ANCHORLESS]` / `[HIGH-WARN-CONSTRAINT-VIOLATION-UNCITED]`. Mirrors v3.7.3 R-L3-1-A asymmetry — `/ars-mark-read` does NOT clear; remediation is fixing the prose.
- **"Claim Intent Manifest Emission" sibling section** added to `synthesis_agent` / `draft_writer_agent` / `report_compiler_agent` per v3.6.7 PATTERN PROTECTION pattern. The §3a SHA-pinned blocks stay byte-equivalent to commit `e7e775a0e1b4`.
- **Calibration runner** (`scripts/claim_audit_calibration.py` + `scripts/test_claim_audit_calibration.py` + `scripts/fixtures/claim_audit_calibration/gold_set.json`) — 20-tuple gold set (12 alignment + 8 constraint); T-C1 threshold gate (FNR < 0.15 + FPR < 0.10), T-C2 per-class FNR/FPR, T-C3 gold-set shape integrity. Re-run: `PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m unittest scripts.test_claim_audit_calibration -v`.
- **2 new lints + 1 new pytest module + 7 new unittest modules wired into CI** (`.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`): `check_claim_audit_consistency.py` (38 invariant checks + schema validation), `check_v3_8_annotation_literal_sync.py` (formatter-finalizer literal drift gate). Test suite: 194 unittest tests across the 7 modules.

**Review trail (Step 13 dual-track, 2026-05-16):** 8 rounds codex (gpt-5.5 xhigh) + 1 round Gemini 3.1-pro-preview before Gemini quota exhausted. Trajectory R1 4P1+2P2 → R2 0P1+3P2 → R3 0P1+5P2 → R4 2P1+2P2 → R5 0P1+2P2+1P3 → R6 1P1+1P2 → R7 1P1+1P2+1P3 → **R8 0P1+4P2 → ship**. Per `feedback_codex_review_surface_loop_design_phase.md` design-phase P2 noise floor doesn't auto-converge; the user declared ship signal at R8 with all P0/P1 closed and 4 R8 P2 carried over to v3.8.1 ([#120](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/120)).

### #115 — Semantic Scholar client maturity: throttle + outage latch (2026-05-15)

**Parent issue:** [#115](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/115) — follow-up to #105 PR codex round-5 [P2]×2 findings (R5-2 throttle + R5-3 outage latch). Both deferred during #105 ship per architectural-inflection discipline; this entry closes the SS-client maturity gap.

**Modified files:**

- `scripts/semantic_scholar_client.py` — two additions:
  - **Throttle** (#115 R5-2): new ctor params `clock` + `min_interval_seconds`. Defaults: 1.0s unauthenticated (1 req/s per protocol), auto-drops to 0.1s when `S2_API_KEY` detected (authenticated 10 req/s tier). Pre-request pacing tracks `_last_request_at`; sleeps `max(0, min_interval - elapsed)` before each call. First request passes through.
  - **Outage latch** (#115 R5-3): `_latched_unavailable` flag set on `URLError`. Subsequent `lookup()` calls short-circuit with `SemanticScholarUnavailable` without invoking urlopen. New `reset_outage_latch()` method lets long-running tools retry between passport batches. HTTP 5xx does NOT latch (server-side error ≠ transport outage).
- `scripts/test_semantic_scholar_client.py` — 9 new tests (5 throttle: first-no-sleep / back-to-back / past-interval / authenticated-tier / override; 3 latch: URLError short-circuits / reset restores / 5xx does not latch; 1 efficiency: 429-retry refreshes throttle anchor).
- `scripts/contamination_signals.py` — new `reset_client_outage_latch(client)` helper. Production clients implementing the outage-latch pattern expose `reset_outage_latch()`; mocks may not. Helper invokes when present, no-ops when absent — avoids AttributeError when callers swap clients. 2 new tests.
- `scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py` — `migrate_directory` resets the SS client's outage latch between passports so a transient network blip on one passport doesn't permanently disable lookups for the rest of the directory. Within a single passport the latch still short-circuits to protect a dead service from N retry waves.

**Production behavior change:**

- `_build_default_ss_client()` API unchanged (`SemanticScholarClient()` no-arg). New throttle is automatic per protocol — no migration tool changes required.
- For a 5000-entry unauthenticated migration: same ~1.5hr runtime (already constrained by 1 req/s); now achieves it via deterministic pacing rather than 429-retry exhaustion.
- For an authenticated migration (`S2_API_KEY` set): drops to 0.1s/call = ~8min for 5000 entries.
- Network outage during large corpus: previously retried every entry independently (up to 30s timeout per entry on the slow path); now the first URLError latches the client and subsequent entries short-circuit until the next batch boundary calls `reset_outage_latch()`. The `migrate_directory` helper does this reset automatically between passports.

**Out of scope:** migration tool (`migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py`) — #105 partial-fill / provenance contract correct as shipped. Protocol doc — already correct; this issue is implementation alignment.

**Regression:** 472 unittest (+8 #115 tests) + 201 pytest adapters + spec_consistency + preprint_venues all green.

### #105 — v3.7.3 contamination_signals backfill migration tool (2026-05-15)

**Parent issue:** [#105](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/105). Spec anchor: v3.7.3 §3.2 R-L3-2-B (the deferred batch operation; bibliography_agent computes signals at ingest, this tool delivers post-hoc backfill on legacy corpora). Design: `docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-105-contamination-signals-backfill-design.md`.

**New files:**

- `scripts/contamination_signals.py` — two pure-function resolvers + emission rules + `SemanticScholarClient` protocol. `compute_preprint_signal()` (Signal 1, deterministic year+venue check against 10-server closed list). `compute_ss_unmatched_signal()` (Signal 2, dependency-injected SS client, returns `None` on manual exemption + API degradation per spec).
- `scripts/migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py` — CLI tool: `[--dry-run] [--verbose] <passport_or_dir>`. Uses `ruamel.yaml` round-trip to preserve comments + key order + quoting style. Reports `processed / patched / skipped_already_migrated / skipped_insufficient_data` counts. Idempotent.
- `scripts/test_contamination_signals.py` — 25 unit tests covering Signal 1 (15 cases: 10 preprint venues × year boundary, non-preprint venue, missing year, missing venue), Signal 2 (6 cases: manual exemption / match / no-match / API degradation × 2 paths / unexpected exception), emission rules (4 cases).
- `scripts/test_migrate_literature_corpus_to_v3_7_3.py` — 9 unittest cases covering dry-run, full migration per emission rules, idempotency, insufficient-data skip, empty-corpus passport, directory scan (non-recursive), comment preservation.
- `docs/migration/v3.7.3-contamination-signals-backfill.md` — user-facing migration guide (when to run, dry-run workflow, idempotency, SS API rate-limit considerations, what's out of scope).

**Modified files:**

- `shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json` — purely additive: new optional `contamination_signals_backfilled_at` field (ISO-8601 date-time string). Existing v3.7.3 ingest-time entries (which lack this field) remain valid; pre-v3.7.3 entries (which lack both this field and `contamination_signals`) remain valid.
- `scripts/adapters/tests/test_literature_corpus_entry_schema.py` — 3 new tests for the additive field (valid present / absent / non-string rejected).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — add `ruamel.yaml>=0.17`.

**Open-question resolutions (user-chosen 2026-05-15):**

- Q1 API rate-limit handling: backoff-only via existing SS protocol (429 → 2s × 3); no resumable checkpoint (YAGNI per minimal scope)
- Q2 schema field naming: scalar `contamination_signals_backfilled_at` ISO-8601 timestamp; strictly additive upgrade path if v3.7.4 needs structured provenance
- Q3 multi-passport batch mode: directory-scan only; no `--input-list` (YAGNI)
- Q4 YAML library: `ruamel.yaml` round-trip to preserve user-owned passport formatting (memory `feedback_toml_duplicate_table_corruption` spirit)

**Spec discipline (per v3.7.3 R-L3-2-B):**

- Migration is offline + opt-in: user explicitly invokes; pipeline doesn't auto-trigger
- Idempotency keyed on `contamination_signals` presence: first-migration timestamp preserved across re-runs
- `obtained_via=manual` exemption preserved at migration time (semantic_scholar_unmatched field omitted, matches the v3.7.3 schema cross-field rule)
- API degradation → field omitted (NOT set to False, per "absence ≠ negative confirmation" rule)

**Files explicitly NOT touched:**

- `deep-research/agents/bibliography_agent.md` — v3.7.3 ingest-time computation frozen
- `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` — finalizer behavior unchanged
- Existing `scripts/adapters/*` — adapters produce ingest-time entries; migration is downstream

**Regression status:** 1053 #108 baseline + 17 #111 baseline + 25 resolver + 9 migration + 3 schema = 1107 total. All green. No regression on the existing 4 `allOf` cross-field invariants (manual exemption + preprint year=2024 boundary verified by adapter pytest).

### #104 — README motivation: add Zhao et al. corpus-scale evidence anchor (2026-05-15)

**Parent issue:** [#104](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/104). Doc-only — no code changes.

Adds a third evidence anchor to the `### Why human-in-the-loop, not full automation?` README section, between the ARS positioning paragraph and the PaperOrchestra paragraph. Closes the gap where v3.7.x trust-and-locator machinery appeared in the codebase without its corpus-scale motivation surfaced in the public-facing README.

**Modified files:**

- `README.md` — new Zhao et al. paragraph
- `README.zh-TW.md` — translated equivalent

**Three motivation anchors now read in sequence:**

- Lu et al. (Nature 651:914-919) — case-study evidence of autonomous-pipeline failure modes
- Zhao et al. (arXiv:2605.07723) — corpus-scale evidence of the citation-faithfulness problem (111M references / 2.5M papers / 146,932 conservative 2025 estimate / mid-2024 inflection / 85.3% bioRxiv-to-PMC persistence)
- PaperOrchestra (Song et al., arXiv:2604.05018) — method-level technique source

**Discipline (#104 acceptance criteria):**

- Statistics verified directly against Zhao et al. abstract (111M / 2.5M / 146,932 / conservative qualifier) + v3.7.3 spec which carries the body-level numbers (85.3% bioRxiv→PMC specificity, mid-2024 inflection) through prior 10-round codex + gemini cross-model review.
- No claims that v3.7.x "closes" L3 — only "adds locator infrastructure" / "advisory risk signals".
- L3 attributed to ARS terminology, not the paper's.
- "Motivated by" not "responds to".

### #111 — slr_lineage emission on systematic-review → academic-paper full handoff (2026-05-15, unreleased)

**Parent issue:** [#111](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/111), follow-up to #108 (PR #110, merged 70c8678) round-8 P2 #1. Design: `docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-111-slr-lineage-emission-design.md`.

> Version label `v3.7.4` below is provisional and will be confirmed at the next release sweep per `feedback_version_bump_sweep_checklist.md`. If this work ships as part of v3.7.3 (the in-progress release at writing time), the version stamps in this entry and the prose files below are swept to the final label at release tag.

Closes the pipeline-plumbing gap surfaced by #108: `disclosure --policy-anchor=prisma-trAIce` now dispatches automatically when the documented `deep-research systematic-review → academic-paper full → disclosure` path runs, without the user manually supplying `mode=systematic-review` at cold-start.

**New files added:**

- `scripts/slr_lineage.py` — two pure functions: (a) `resolve_from_stages(stages)` returns `True` iff any stage was produced by `deep-research` in systematic-review mode (bound to the deep-research producer specifically — a non-deep-research stage carrying mode='systematic-review' does NOT trigger SLR lineage); (b) `emit(stages, incoming_slr_lineage)` is the monotonic-OR wrapper the orchestrator calls at every handoff. The OR preserves any signal already persisted on the incoming passport (load-bearing for `resume_from_passport=<hash>` sessions whose `state_tracker.stages` is empty — codex round-1 [P2] closure).
- `scripts/test_slr_lineage_emission.py` — 17 conformance tests: resolver semantics (7 cases: positive / non-SLR / mid-entry / empty / alias `slr` / non-deep-research / missing-mode), renderer integration (3 cases: pipeline-emitted dispatches without `mode_param` / non-SLR still blocks / pre-#111 cold-start fallback preserved), end-to-end pipeline handoff (2 cases), and monotonic-OR emit semantics (5 cases: resume preserves true / in-session false-to-true / no-evidence false / None incoming / default arg ergonomics).

**Modified files:**

- `shared/handoff_schemas.md` — Schema 9 Material Passport gains optional top-level `slr_lineage: boolean` row + dedicated "Run-level lineage signal (v3.7.4)" subsection documenting semantics, producer, consumer, backward compat, and G1 boundary note (passport-level vs corpus-entry-level distinction).
- `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` — §4 Transition Management gains a "Run-level lineage emission (v3.7.4+)" step computed at every handoff transition before dispatch. Passport carry-line updated to reference `slr_lineage` from v3.7.4+.

**Files explicitly NOT touched (matches #111 §Scope out-of-scope):**

- `scripts/policy_anchor_disclosure_referee.py` — #108 referee, contract unchanged
- `academic-paper/references/policy_anchor_disclosure_protocol.md` — #108 protocol, unchanged
- `academic-paper/references/policy_anchor_table.md` — #108 anchor table, unchanged
- `academic-paper/references/disclosure_mode_protocol.md` — already references `slr_lineage` as pipeline-supplied
- `shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json` — G1 invariant frozen (corpus entry schema, not passport schema)

**G1 boundary clarification:** Decision Doc §4.4 #11 G1 invariant scope is `literature_corpus_entry.schema.json` (corpus entry data schema). Schema 9 Material Passport top-level extensions follow the v3.6.3 (`reset_boundary[]`) / v3.6.4 (`literature_corpus[]`) / v3.6.7 (`audit_artifact[]`) precedent and are permitted per Decision Doc §4.4 #11's "non-renderer code changes for §4.4 concerns are permitted" provision.

**Backward compat:** passports written by pre-v3.7.4 runs lack the `slr_lineage` field; renderer treats absence as `false` (cold-start path requiring explicit `mode_param='systematic-review'`). Identical to pre-v3.7.4 behavior.

**Regression status:** 1053-baseline frozen (no #108 contract drift); +17 new tests cover this issue's acceptance criteria #1-#3 plus codex round-1 [P2] (monotonic-OR emit across resume).

### #108 — AI disclosure policy-anchor renderer (2026-05-14, audit-trail-shipped)

**Parent docs:** Decision Doc (`docs/design/2026-05-14-ai-disclosure-schema-decision.md`, PR #109, merged commit 20ed72d) + implementation spec (`docs/design/2026-05-14-ai-disclosure-impl-spec.md`).

**Migration note (G1 + G6 invariants):** **no migration required**. Decision Doc §2.1 G1 invariant: no `ai_disclosure` field is added to `shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json`. Decision Doc §3 G6: no deprecation horizon — legacy entries (which by §1 fact-check do not carry any AI-disclosure field today) stay byte-equivalent. The implementation extends the runtime renderer path, not the data schema.

**New files added:**

- `academic-paper/references/policy_anchor_table.md` — 4-anchor (PRISMA-trAIce / ICMJE / Nature / IEEE) × 16-field source-of-truth reference table carrying verbatim policy quotes lifted from discovery doc §4.3-4.6 (PR #107, commit 299c4b6) + per-anchor renderer rules.
- `academic-paper/references/policy_anchor_disclosure_protocol.md` — LLM-prose runtime protocol for the new `--policy-anchor=<a>` track: 7-section flow covering inputs / G10 7-row precedence table / per-anchor render flows / auto-promotion forbiddance / venue-anchor conflict resolution / three-state completeness flag / 11-concern resolution map.
- `shared/policy_data/nature_policy.md` — canonical Nature substantive policy source; both the policy-anchor track and the v3.2 venue track cross-reference this path for the G4 dedup invariant.
- `scripts/check_policy_anchor_table.py` + `scripts/test_check_policy_anchor_table.py` — anchor table structural lint with 13 mutation tests + Nature dedup guard wired into the main lint command.
- `scripts/check_policy_anchor_protocol.py` + `scripts/test_check_policy_anchor_protocol.py` — protocol doc lint with 12 mutation tests covering §4.3 8 invariants + §4.4 11 concerns + G10 7-row precedence table + auto-promotion forbiddance + anchor inventory closed-enum.
- `scripts/policy_anchor_disclosure_referee.py` + `scripts/test_policy_anchor_disclosure.py` — executable specification (referee) of §3 G10 7-row decision table + 8 invariant predicates; 61 conformance tests covering every (input × expected output) combination + forbidden-path negative fixtures.

**Modified files:**

- `academic-paper/references/disclosure_mode_protocol.md` — `--policy-anchor=<a>` track added in parallel to v3.2 `--venue=<v>` track. Phase 1 dispatch becomes selector-aware (step 1a / step 1b venue / step 1c anchor). Venue-only flow unchanged; anchor flow delegates Phase 3+4 to `policy_anchor_disclosure_protocol.md`. Concern #7 venue+anchor conflict resolution enforced.
- `academic-paper/references/venue_disclosure_policies.md` — Nature entry gains derivation note + dedup pointer to `shared/policy_data/nature_policy.md`. v3.2 venue rendering content unchanged (derived view, manual sync to canonical source until future refactor).
- `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` — 5 new CI steps wiring the new validators and conformance test suite into the existing spec-consistency job.

**§4.4 11 open concerns resolved** (4 user-chosen, 7 inline; full table in impl spec §3):
1. Track-selection lookup: explicit `slr_lineage` input from pipeline orchestrator (user-chosen).
2. Tool identity collection: auto-detect from session metadata (mirror v3.2 Phase 4).
3. Prompt scope: per-(tool × task) tuple per PRISMA M6.a.
4. IEEE section locator: free-form list with recommended IMRaD exemplars.
5. Nature image metadata: hybrid output channel (annotation block + suggested inline patches) (user-chosen).
6. UNCERTAIN per-facet finalization: USED-full + per-facet annotation alongside still-UNCERTAIN (user-chosen).
7. Venue+anchor conflict: reject conflicting selectors with explicit error.
8. Three-state completeness flag: full computation logic encoded in §6 of protocol doc.
9. Test set scope: 86 new tests covering 8 invariants + 10 concerns × {positive, negative}.
10. `ai_used:true` substantive-content gate: force v3.2 categorization flow (user-chosen).
11. G1 invariant scope: data layer untouched; non-renderer pipeline plumbing permitted.

**Known follow-up (out of #108 scope):** the academic-pipeline orchestrator does not yet emit `slr_lineage` on the documented `systematic-review → academic-paper full` handoff. Authors targeting `--policy-anchor=prisma-trAIce` must supply `mode=systematic-review` manually until that plumbing lands in a separate PR (touches `academic-pipeline/` + `shared/handoff_schemas.md`, outside §4.1 items 1-5 NO-CHANGE boundary).

**Regression status:** 967 baseline + 86 new tests = 1053 passing / 3 skipped / 0 failed. Public-repo boundary clean. Eight rounds of codex gpt-5.5 xhigh review (R1 4 P2 → R8 2 P2); shipped audit-trail-complete per user decision rather than pushing past Decision Doc 11-round high water mark. R8 P2 #1 captured as the known follow-up above.

### v3.7.3 — claim faithfulness locator + contaminated-source advisory (2026-05-12, in progress)

**External motivation:** Zhao, Wang, Stuart, De Vaan, Ginsparg, Yin "LLM hallucinations in the wild: Large-scale evidence from non-existent citations" (arXiv:2605.07723, 2026-05). Corpus-scale audit of 111M references across 2.5M papers across arXiv / bioRxiv / SSRN / PMC finds 146,932 hallucinated citations estimated for 2025 alone, with the inflection point at mid-2024, 85.3% of preprint hallucinations surviving into the published record, and Google Scholar increasingly indexing citation-only entries. The paper names the L3 (claim faithfulness) gap explicitly: *"real citations deployed to support claims the cited references do not actually make ... remains an open challenge for which reliable detection methods remain under active development."* v3.7.3 closes the locator-channel half of that gap (anchor infrastructure for future L3 audit) and surfaces two contamination signals (preprint post-LLM-inflection + Semantic Scholar unmatched) as advisory cite-time markers.

**L3-1 — Three-Layer Citation Emission (claim faithfulness locator):**

- `deep-research/agents/synthesis_agent.md`, `academic-paper/agents/draft_writer_agent.md`, `deep-research/agents/report_compiler_agent.md` gain `## Three-Layer Citation Emission (v3.7.3)` H2 section that extends v3.7.1 Two-Layer with a third hidden marker: `<!--anchor:<kind>:<value>-->` where `<kind>` ∈ `{quote, page, section, paragraph, none}`. Production-mandatory locator rule (R-L3-1-A) requires `<kind>` ≠ `none` for every visible citation; emitting `none` triggers finalizer MED-WARN-NO-LOCATOR (gate-refused). Quote anchors capped at 25 words by whitespace split (R-L3-1-B). Anchor values come from corpus context only — no frontmatter reads (R-L3-1-C, inherits v3.6.7 partial-inversion discipline).
- `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` gains a `## Cite-Time Provenance Finalizer — v3.7.3 extension` H2 section: 4-cell matrix becomes 5-cell along a new precedence-zero locator-presence axis. NO-LOCATOR resolution: `[UNVERIFIED CITATION — NO QUOTE OR PAGE LOCATOR]<!--ref:slug--><!--anchor:none:-->`.
- `academic-paper/agents/formatter_agent.md` gains a `## Cite-Time Provenance Hard Gate (v3.7.1 + v3.7.3)` section formalizing the terminal hard-gate refusal across all three v3.7.x severity tiers (HIGH-WARN-NO-ORIGINAL, MED-WARN-NOT-CROSS-CHECKED, MED-WARN-NO-LOCATOR).

**L3-2 — Contaminated-source advisory signals:**

- `shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json` adds optional `contamination_signals: { preprint_post_llm_inflection, semantic_scholar_unmatched }` object. Both sub-fields optional within the object; both default to absent (signals not computed). `additionalProperties: false` enforced on the sub-object. Backward compat: entries without the field stay valid.
- `deep-research/agents/bibliography_agent.md` gains `## Contamination Signal Computation (v3.7.3)` section. Signal 1 (`preprint_post_llm_inflection`): `year >= 2024 AND venue ∈ {arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SSRN, Research Square, Preprints.org}`. Signal 2 (`semantic_scholar_unmatched`): existing Semantic Scholar API protocol returns no match by DOI or title; exempted when `obtained_via: manual`; omitted (not `false`) on API degradation.
- Pipeline finalizer (in pipeline_orchestrator) annotates `ok` / `LOW-WARN` markers with `CONTAMINATED-PREPRINT` / `CONTAMINATED-UNMATCHED` / `CONTAMINATED-PREPRINT+UNMATCHED` suffix per `contamination_signals` state. Annotations are **advisory only** — they do NOT change the gate decision (v3.5 Collaboration Depth Observer precedent).

**Lint + tests:**

- New `scripts/check_v3_7_3_three_layer_citation.py` static lint: every `<!--ref:slug-->` must be followed by `<!--anchor:<kind>:<value>-->`; `quote` values ≤25 words; orphan anchors rejected.
- New `scripts/test_check_v3_7_3_three_layer_citation.py`: 14 tests covering positive (5 kinds × passing cases, contamination-suffix marker, LOW-WARN-resolved marker, multi-citation) + negative (bare ref, orphan anchor, invalid kind, 26-word quote).
- New 6 contamination_signals tests in `scripts/adapters/tests/test_literature_corpus_entry_schema.py`: absence / empty / both-false / both-true / unknown-subfield-rejected / non-boolean-rejected.
- New `V373ExtensionLineBudgetTest` in `scripts/test_v3_6_7_phase_6_6.py`: 60-line budget for `## Cite-Time Provenance Finalizer — v3.7.3 extension` block; existing Phase 6.6 +60 v3.6.7 budget test updated to subtract both v3.7.1 Step 3b AND v3.7.3 extension lines.

**Regression status (final, post round-10 convergence):** 967 tests pass, 3 skipped, 0 failed (42 new tests across rounds 1-10 fixes; pre-review baseline was 925). v3.6.7 + v3.6.8 + v3.7.1 + v3.7.2 lints all PASS unmodified. v3.6.7 PATTERN PROTECTION blocks remain byte-equivalent (SHA gate v2 unchanged). Material Passport literature_corpus_entry schema backward compatible (new contamination_signals field optional; cross-field rules only fire when explicitly set). New v3.7.3 lint wired into spec-consistency.yml CI workflow per F18.

**Cross-model review closure (2026-05-12, 11 rounds total — 10 codex + 1 gemini cross-model):**

| Round | Reviewer | Findings | Closures |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (initial) | Codex | 0 P1 / 2 P2 | F3 (untracked artifacts → closed at commit), F4 (NO-LOCATOR acknowledgment contradiction → removed `/ars-mark-read` promise from formatter+finalizer+spec Q5) |
| 1 (initial) | Gemini 3.1-pro-preview | 2 P1 / 2 P2 / 1 P3 | F1 (hyphen-encode → 3 prompts + lint + 3 tests), F2 (whitespace/newline tolerance → finalizer clarification + 4 tests), F5 (year<2024 schema cross-field → allOf + 4 tests), F6 (venue list 6 → 10 added ChemRxiv / EarthArXiv / OSF Preprints / TechRxiv), F7 (fenced code block isolation → helper + 4 tests) |
| 2 | Codex | 0 P1 / 2 P2 | F8 (lint regex widened to {0,2} suffix tokens → 3 tests), F9 (empty non-`none` anchor value rejection → 5 tests) |
| 3 | Codex | 0 P1 / 2 P2 | F10 (premature HTML comment terminator sentinel scan → 3 tests), F11 (schema manual-entry exemption → 4 tests) |
| 4 | Codex | 0 P1 / 1 P2 / 1 P3 | F12 (orphan_pattern lookbehind removed → 3 tests), F13 (schema venue list description sync 6 → 10) |
| 5 | Codex | 0 P1 / 1 P2 | F14 (malformed ref broad-scan detector → 4 tests) |
| 6 | Codex | 0 P1 / 1 P2 | F15 (prompt-vs-lint alignment on `--` rule → 2 tests; prompts loosened to match lint's narrower contract) |
| 7 | Codex | 0 P1 / 3 P2 | F16 (finalizer status-suffix-tolerant for revision-loop reruns), F17 (standalone deep-research self-gate), F18 (CI workflow wires v3.7.3 lint into spec-consistency.yml) |
| 8 | Codex | 0 P1 / 3 P2 | F19 (decode value before empty check → 3 tests), F20 (formatter raw `anchor:none` gate), F21 (F17 self-gate scoped to standalone mode only via prompt mode-detection) |
| 9 | Codex | 0 P1 / 1 P2 | F22 (self-gate also rejects bare refs without anchor — parity with pipeline finalizer's precedence-zero "no anchor = anchor=none" rule) |
| **10 (final)** | **Codex** | **0 findings** | **Convergence achieved.** |

- **No cross-finding overlap across reviewers.** Codex and Gemini found complementary defect classes — Codex caught contract gaps + regex completeness + architectural integration; Gemini caught HTML comment parsing edge cases + cross-field schema rules + venue completeness. This is the canonical value split documented in `feedback_codex_workflow_consolidated.md`.
- **Cascade pattern:** each round's closure introduced no new defects in its OWN scope, but interactions with other v3.7.3 surfaces surfaced new layers — F19 was an F9 layer (encoded-whitespace bypass after the F9 raw-value fix), F21 was a F17 regression (self-gate ran in pipeline mode and interfered with finalizer), F22 was an F17+F21 boundary (only catching explicit `none` markers missed bare-ref legacy form). The 10-round convergence trajectory is consistent with the v3.6.8 18-round implementation precedent and `feedback_complex_spec_review_inventory_pattern.md`.
- **F23+ not yet observed.** Round 10 returned no findings on the 9th amended branch state, providing the convergence signal. Future codex challenge mode (adversarial scope) may surface architecturally deeper gaps; tracked separately as a v3.7.4+ concern.

**Out of v3.7.3 scope (tracked as follow-up issues):**

- v3.7.4 retrieval-side hardening: OpenAlex + Crossref triangulation as second contamination signal (Vector 2 currently single-source via Semantic Scholar only).
- v3.8 L3 full audit: `claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent` running LLM-as-judge over (claim, ref full-text) pairs. v3.7.3 anchors are the input; v3.8 verifies anchor content faithfulness.
- AI disclosure schema split (per-stage: drafting / editing / **reference suggestion** / data analysis) — Zhao et al. Fig. 1l correlates AI-writing-signature with hallucination rate.
- Public README motivation update citing arXiv:2605.07723.
- Migration tool for legacy `literature_corpus[]` entries lacking `contamination_signals`.

### Backlog — gbrain harness borrow analysis (2026-05-10, post codex review)

Source: 2026-05-10 analysis of `garrytan/gbrain` (14.2k★ agent harness for OpenClaw/Hermes), with codex cross-model review same day. Two candidates surfaced; they have different risk profiles and are tracked separately.

**Candidate A — Shared `shared/_invariants.md` cross-skill rules file** (gbrain pattern P3). Status: backlog, low-risk.

ARS cross-cutting rules are scattered today: Iron Rules in adapter overview, hedging contract in `protected_hedging_phrases.md`, citation precedence in agents' frontmatter, integrity gates referenced from multiple SKILL.md. When a rule evolves (e.g. v3.6.5 corpus protocol Iron Rules), secondary mentions drift.

Shape if adopted:
- `shared/_invariants.md` enumerating **positive invariants only** (no rejected-reasoning column; that was the contamination vector in the 2026-05-10 anti-pattern-table evaluation)
- File stays short, normative, and example-free — additional examples turn invariants into demonstrations and re-introduce few-shot drift
- Each SKILL.md references it via a stronger convention than `## See Also` (which reads as optional reading); proposed wording at adoption time
- Frontmatter `validated_against: <version>` enables a stale-reference grep job on minor bumps. **The grep job detects version drift only — it does NOT validate semantic compliance.** Semantic checks remain a human / codex review responsibility.

**Candidate B — Declarative `shared/_review_pairs.yaml` cross-model review config** (gbrain pattern P6). Status: **needs design spike before becoming a real candidate**, higher-risk.

ARS cross-model review is currently invoked imperatively: `ARS_CROSS_MODEL=1` env flag + manual codex review per phase. A declarative `(deliverable_kind, reviewer_model, dimensions, when_to_invoke)` map could improve reproducibility for Stage 2.5 / 4.5 integrity gates and Phase 6 in-pair evaluator review.

Three open problems before this is shippable:
1. **Refusal-routing semantics conflict.** gbrain's chain (primary → DeepSeek → Qwen → Groq, silent switch) routes past refusal; ARS treats reviewer disagreement as signal. Borrowing the YAML format without resolving this imports the wrong invariant. Likely answer is "borrow the declarative-pairing shape, drop the refusal-routing chain entirely."
2. **Embedding governance in config.** A YAML that decides "this deliverable triggers this reviewer with these dimensions" is workflow policy. Wrong shape locks in a bad routing decision across all phases. Needs a usage survey of existing manual invocations before designing the schema.
3. **Lower confidence than Candidate A.** ARS already has review phases and cross-model invocation working manually; the missing piece is reproducibility, not the capability. If manual invocation isn't causing missed reviews or inconsistent reviews in practice, this should drop too.

Rejected from same gbrain analysis: P1 RESOLVER.md dispatcher (10 slash commands serve dispatch), P4 trust boundary (research tool, no untrusted caller class), P5 pain-triggered subagent routing (covered in user CLAUDE.md, repo-level not relevant). **P2 friction protocol** is a soft reject — codex review pointed out a first-class friction CLI captures pain at the moment of pain, which 5+ round codex review at deliverable-time does not. Re-examine if ARS skill development surfaces recurring author-time pain that retrospective review doesn't capture.

Meta-lesson from this analysis: "we already do something adjacent" is weaker than it sounds as a reject reason. The test is whether the existing mechanism captures the same signal at the same time with the same enforcement strength.

### Added (v3.6.7 Step 6 Phase 6.8 — Step 8 evaluation case)

- **17 micro-fixtures + 1 chapter-level integration fixture** under
  `tests/fixtures/v3_6_7_pattern_eval/` exercising the 17 numbered downstream
  -agent patterns (A1–A5, B1–B5, C1–C3, D1–D4) per spec §7. Each micro
  fixture: `manifest.json` (`fixture_kind: "micro"`) + `upstream_context/`
  (`passport_snippet.yaml` + `prior_artifacts/`) + `bad_run/` + `good_run/`
  with `deliverable.md`, `expected_audit_findings.yaml`,
  `expected_orchestrator_action.yaml`. Integration fixture under
  `integration/chapter_level_run/` exercises A3+C2+D4+C1 across 3-round
  MATERIAL escalation → ship_with_known_residue acknowledgement per §7.3.
- **`scripts/check_pattern_eval_manifest.py`** — fixture_kind discriminator
  routing micro (§7.2) vs integration (§7.3) JSON Schema 2020-12 manifest
  schemas; `audit_verdict.schema.json` validation on every
  `expected_audit_findings.yaml`; path-safety rejects absolute paths and `..`
  segments; coverage cross-check enforces 17/17 numbered IDs covered (with
  hard-fail on unknown directory names per §7.5).
- **`scripts/test_pattern_eval_runtime.py`** — 112-test parametrized harness
  reading expected verdicts as synthesized output and asserting against
  expected orchestrator action. Per-pattern parametrized tests (BAD signal +
  GOOD passes + run_id F1 regex + BAD/GOOD uniqueness); integration state
  runner driving §7.3 5-step procedure (load verdicts → drive §5.6 → verify
  pipeline state per round → feed escalation user_response → verify final
  passport state); Path A re-verification axis (≥6 A7 happy-path legs at
  rounds 2+3); finding-id lineage carry-forward per audit-template Section 6;
  per-phase synthetic injections (24 of 26 PHASE_TO_PASSPORT_MUTATION rows
  validated for "none" / "appended"); A1.5 supersession-preflight axis tests.
- **`scripts/test_run_codex_audit_e2e.py`** — Phase 6.1 deferred end-to-end
  dispatch test (Linux Bash 4+ only; macOS stock Bash 3.2 self-skips). Mocks
  codex CLI via PATH-prefix shim emitting canonical Phase 2 JSONL stream.
  Validates wrapper produces 4 contract files + 3 diagnostic files; proposal
  entry validates against `audit_artifact_entry.schema.json --mode proposal`
  (Pattern C3 defense — `verified_at`/`verified_by` absent); `--dry-run`
  writes nothing; `--round=2` without `--previous-findings` rejected with
  `EX_USAGE`.
- **`.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`** — 4 new CI steps: Phase 6.8
  manifest validation, pattern-eval-unit (micro fixtures + phase inventory +
  synthetic non-supersession), pattern-eval-integration (integration fixture
  + synthetic supersession), Phase 6.1 wrapper E2E (Linux runner only).
- **`docs/design/TODO-l-doc-1-18-patterns-prose-retirement.md`** — files
  L-doc-1 follow-up enumerating 8 retirement locations for the docs-only PR
  retiring "18 patterns" prose to "17 patterns" per §9.2.
- **Spec amendments** at `docs/design/2026-04-30-ars-v3.6.7-step-6-orchestrator
  -hooks-spec.md`: §7.4 success criterion 1 prose updated for C2 MINOR
  special case + D2 PASS convergence-policy assertion; §7.4 phase example
  updated `escalation` → `B11`; §7.6 deployment note explaining named-step
  CI deployment (vs literal "two separate jobs"); §9.2 L-doc-1 row points at
  the TODO file; §7.3 example manifest snippet updated to F-101/F-103.

### Notes

- **11 codex review rounds converged to 0 findings**. Cumulative 24
  findings closed (4 P1 + 18 P2 + 2 P3) across rounds 1-10.
- 135 Phase 6.8-specific tests; total repo regression 742 pytest + 251
  unittest = 993 green + 3 skipped (macOS Bash 3.2 wrapper E2E gate).
- v3.6.7 Step 6 + Step 8 now structurally complete: prompt-level pattern
  protection (Step 1+2) + version sweep (Step 7) + runtime audit-artifact
  gate (Step 6 §1-§11 + Phases 6.1-6.7) + synthetic evaluation case
  (Phase 6.8) deliver the §10 ship-quality target.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-05-05

> **Claude Code plugin packaging.** ARS now installs in one line on Claude Code
> CLI / VS Code / JetBrains via `/plugin marketplace add Imbad0202/academic-research-skills`
> + `/plugin install academic-research-skills`. The traditional
> `git clone + symlink to ~/.claude/skills/` flow continues to work — both
> tracks are first-class.

### Added

- **Plugin manifest + marketplace metadata** (Phase 1, PR #68).
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares the suite. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  registers the plugin so a single GitHub-hosted endpoint serves both the
  marketplace listing and the plugin source. `skills/` directory carries
  relative symlinks to the four existing skill directories so the plugin
  loader auto-discovers them without moving repo layout.
- **10 slash commands** at `commands/ars-*.md` (Phase 2.1, PR #69) mapping
  `MODE_REGISTRY.md` entries to `/ars-<mode>` triggers. Model routing pinned
  in each command's frontmatter — `opus` for `full` and `revision-coach`
  (architectural / review-interpretation depth), `sonnet` for the other 8.
  No Haiku per `feedback_no_haiku.md`.
- **3 plugin-shipped agents** at `agents/*_agent.md` (Phase 2.1, PR #69)
  as relative symlinks to the v3.6.7-hardened downstream agents in
  `deep-research/agents/`: `synthesis_agent`, `research_architect_agent`,
  `report_compiler_agent`. Underscore filenames preserved to match
  `scripts/check_v3_6_7_pattern_protection.py` hard-pinned paths and the
  INV-3 manifest-confined Clause 1 invariant. Symlinks (not copies) preserve
  a single source of truth and prevent the Pattern C3 attack surface that
  v3.6.7 §6 inversion sweep + INV-1/2/3 lint closes.
- **`model: inherit`** added to those three source agent frontmatters
  (PR #69 R1 codex finding). Inherit chosen over pinning `sonnet` so an
  Opus session running the full pipeline keeps Opus agents (instead of
  being capped) while the user's existing PreToolUse `warn-agent-no-model.sh`
  hook gates Haiku at the dispatch boundary.
- **SessionStart announce hook** at `hooks/hooks.json` +
  `scripts/announce-ars-loaded.sh` (Phase 2.2, PR #70). When the plugin
  loads, the hook injects `additionalContext` listing the 10 slash commands,
  the 3 plugin agents, and a token-budget pointer into the LLM's first
  turn. `startup` and `clear` source values get the full announce; `resume`
  and `compact` get a one-line ack to avoid burning context on every
  resume. Bash 3.2 compatible — runs on macOS stock `/bin/bash` with no
  `brew install bash` requirement. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` quoted for
  install paths containing spaces.
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` + `.zh-TW.md`** subsection
  "v3.7.0 Plugin agents and model routing" explaining `model: inherit`
  semantics and the current 3-agent scope boundary.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** Evolution Timeline extended with v3.6.7 / v3.6.8 /
  v3.7.0 entries.
- **README + README.zh-TW** version badge bumped to v3.7.0; Pipeline section
  heading bumped to v3.7; CHANGELOG entry added.

### Deferred (future release)

- **SubagentStop → `run_codex_audit.sh` codex audit hook** (Phase 2.2 scope
  reduction). Two compounding reasons: (a) wrong invoker class —
  `run_codex_audit.sh` lines 4–7 forbid same-session in-LLM invocation
  (Pattern C3 attack surface), and the original PostToolUse Write|Edit
  matcher would fire from inside the producing session; (b) contract gap —
  the SubagentStop hook payload carries no stage/deliverable info, so a
  wrapper would have to half-infer those required arguments. Real
  audit-hook integration deferred to a future release when ARS gains a stage/deliverable
  propagation contract. See
  `docs/design/2026-04-30-ars-v3.7.0-plugin-packaging-roadmap.md`
  Update note 2026-05-05 (Phase 2.2 scope reduction).

### Changed

- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` frontmatter `version: "3.7.0"` + H1 +
  Version Info table.
- `MODE_REGISTRY.md` Last updated bumped to `v3.7.0 (2026-05-05)`.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Skills Overview row + Suite version footer bumped
  to 3.7.0.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` lint pins (Suite version, README
  badge, MODE_REGISTRY heading, CHANGELOG section heading) bumped to
  v3.7.0.

### Unchanged

The four skill directories, all 25 modes, agent prompts, schema files,
and lint contracts. Plugin packaging only adds new top-level surface
(`commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `skills/` symlink
dir, three plugin-agent `model: inherit` frontmatter additions).
Existing 4.3k clone-install users see no breaking change.

### Codex review chain

8 inline iterative rounds + 3 fresh PR-level rounds across the three
PRs (#68 / #69 / #70), all converging to 0 P0/P1/P2 findings before
merge. The Phase 2.2 fresh PR review caught one P2 (unquoted
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` breaking install paths with spaces) that the
inline rounds missed — confirms the value of separating implementation
review (inline) from contract / install-time review (fresh).

## [3.6.8] - 2026-05-03

> **Naming note**: this release ships the **v3.6.6 generator-evaluator contract**
> spec (`docs/design/2026-04-27-ars-v3.6.6-generator-evaluator-contract-design.md`)
> and its implementation. The v3.6.6 work landed after v3.6.7 due to project
> sequencing; the design doc retains the v3.6.6 internal naming for the
> contract gate version (`writer_full` / `evaluator_full` mode, Schema 13.1,
> `pre_commitment_artifacts` + `disagreement_handling` schema fields), while
> the suite release is tagged v3.6.8 to keep the CHANGELOG monotonic.

### Added

- **Schema 13.1 generator-evaluator contract gate** for `academic-paper full`
  mode (`shared/sprint_contract.schema.json`, design doc §3): two new `mode`
  enum values (`writer_full` + `evaluator_full`); two new optional top-level
  fields (`pre_commitment_artifacts` writer-only with
  `acceptance_criteria_paraphrase.minimum_dimensions`; `disagreement_handling`
  evaluator-only with `paraphrase_minimum_dimensions` + `scoring_plan` +
  `pre_commitment_check_protocol` + `disagreement_resolution`); 12 `allOf`
  branches enforcing reviewer- / writer- / evaluator-conditional gates
  (existing 2 + 10 new per design doc §3.5 table).
- **Two new shipped contract templates**: `shared/contracts/writer/full.json`
  (writer dimensions D1 section_completeness / D2 citation_density /
  D3 argument_blueprint_fidelity / D4 total_word_count /
  D5 per_section_word_count / D6 acknowledged_limitations /
  D7 register_consistency; F-conditions F1/F4/F2/F3/F0; no `scoring_plan`)
  and `shared/contracts/evaluator/full.json` (evaluator dimensions
  D1 originality / D2 methodological_rigor / D3 evidence_sufficiency /
  D4 argument_coherence / D5 writing_quality; F-conditions F1/F2/F3/F6/F4/F5/F0;
  full `scoring_plan` + `disagreement_handling`). Templates already shipped on
  the spec branch as design-time artefacts since 2026-04-28; this release
  promotes them to live status atomically with the Schema 13.1 upgrade.
- **Two-phase orchestration inside `academic-paper full` mode** (design doc §5):
  Phase 4 splits into Phase 4a paper-blind writer pre-commitment + Phase 4b
  paper-visible drafting + self-scoring. Phase 6 splits into Phase 6a
  paper-blind evaluator pre-commitment + Phase 6b paper-visible scoring +
  decision. Phase-numbered `<phase4a_output>` / `<phase6a_output>` data
  delimiters mirror the v3.6.2 reviewer pattern. Lint counts: writer 3+4 /
  evaluator 5+5 / reviewer 5+6 (reviewer surfaces remain zero-touch per §3.6).
  `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED]` abort tag with 5% / three-month operational
  monitor.
- **`academic-paper/SKILL.md` `## v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol`
  orchestration block** (101 lines): four-call structure with system-vs-user
  content discipline, schema-vs-runtime emission distinction, per-phase lint,
  abort handling, two valid Stage 3 entry paths (standard F0/F4 + exceptional
  F5), cross-session resume scope. Plus a new `## Known limitations` section
  carrying the graceful-degradation forward note (v3.6.7 candidate) + the
  cross-session resume `pre_commitment_history[]` forward note (v3.6.7+
  candidate) + in-pair Phase 6 evaluator vs external `academic-paper-reviewer`
  tech debt.
- **`academic-paper/agents/draft_writer_agent.md` + `peer_reviewer_agent.md`**
  each gain a verbatim `## v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol`
  section with the system-prompt sub-sections for Phase 4a/4b (writer) and
  Phase 6a/6b (evaluator). The orchestrator includes the relevant sub-section
  verbatim in the system prompt for the corresponding call; user content
  carries contract JSON, paper metadata, delimiter blocks, and upstream
  artefacts per the SKILL.md discipline.
- **`scripts/check_sprint_contract.py` SC-* mode-gating audit** (per §7.1
  implementation requirement): SC-5 (measurement_procedure canonical outputs)
  and SC-11 (panel_size sanity) now mode-gated to
  `mode.startswith("reviewer_")` so they do not noise on clean writer /
  evaluator templates. SC-9 (paraphrase_minimum_dimensions exceeds dim count)
  extended across all three mode families: reviewer reads
  `mp.paraphrase_minimum_dimensions`, writer reads
  `pre_commitment_artifacts.acceptance_criteria_paraphrase.minimum_dimensions`,
  evaluator reads `disagreement_handling.paraphrase_minimum_dimensions`.
  Mode-agnostic warnings (SC-1 baseline lag, SC-2 single dimension, SC-3 no
  mandatory, SC-4 orphan dim ref, SC-7 conflicting actions, SC-10 unreferenced
  mandatory/high) unchanged.
- **17 new validator tests** (54 → 71 total): 4 writer/evaluator template
  positive tests; 5 schema-branch negative tests covering branches 11 / 12 /
  4 / 5 / 6 hard-fail (cross-mode field leakage intentionally NOT a v3.6.6
  hard-fail per §7.1 R1 settled — v3.7.x `not`-clause hardening is the
  long-term fix); 2 §3.6 reviewer regression tests
  (`test_existing_reviewer_contracts_still_valid_under_13_1` +
  `test_byte_equivalent_validation_for_reviewer_contracts`); 6 SC-5/SC-9/SC-11
  mode-gating tests.
- **`scripts/check_v3_6_6_ab_manifest.py`** (new) implements the §7.5 manifest
  CI lint: schema-shape checks per §6.2 (top-level required fields with
  declared types; per-paper required fields; paper_id uniqueness; aggregate
  role counts 6+1; paper-A paper_type families 3 × 2; paper-A required
  judge_output_baseline; paper-C must-have known_failure_mode +
  failure_evidence; paper-C must-not-have judge / metrics fields);
  path-existence checks (mode-conditional + populated-optional);
  reverse-scan against fixture-orphans; exit-1-on-malformed-YAML mirrors
  `check_sprint_contract.py` convention.
- **`.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`** extends the "Validate sprint
  contract templates" step to iterate writer + evaluator template directories
  alongside the existing reviewer loop, and adds a new "Validate v3.6.6 A/B
  fixture manifest" step running the new manifest CI lint script as an
  additional step inside the existing `spec-consistency` job.
- **`tests/fixtures/v3.6.6-ab/` A/B evidence fixture stub** (30 files):
  manifest.yaml + README.md + 6 paper-A inputs/baseline + 1 paper-C
  inputs/baseline + Stage 3 reviewer excerpt + 6 codex-judge baseline
  placeholders. `manifest_lint_mode: spec_branch`, `fixture_version: 0.1.0`.
  Each placeholder explains the expected populated content; real fixture data
  (existing deep-research synthesis reports for paper-A; v3.6.5 session log
  + Stage 3 reviewer excerpt for paper-C; codex gpt-5.5 + xhigh judge runs
  against paper-A baseline) populates in follow-up commits before the
  v3.6.6 implementation work fully completes.
- **`academic-paper-reviewer/references/sprint_contract_protocol.md`
  cross-reference** noting Schema 13.1 since v3.6.6 + pointing readers at
  `academic-paper/SKILL.md` + design doc §5 for the parallel
  generator-evaluator protocol. The reviewer protocol itself is byte-equivalent
  across v3.6.2 → v3.6.8 (zero-touch promise per §3.6).

### Changed

- **Suite version**: v3.6.7 → v3.6.8 (per the naming note above; design doc
  retains v3.6.6 for the contract gate version).
- **`academic-pipeline` skill version** bumped from v3.6.7 to v3.6.8 in the
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Skills Overview table.

### Deferred

- **Real fixture data populate** for `tests/fixtures/v3.6.6-ab/` (30
  placeholders → real paper-A inputs + baseline + paper-C session log + codex
  judge runs) lands in follow-up commits.
- **Treatment runs** (writer Phase 4a/4b + evaluator Phase 6a/6b on the seven
  fixtures), **codex judge against treatment**, and **metrics computation
  + summary.md** require actual `academic-paper full` invocations + Semantic
  Scholar API + codex CLI runs; deferred to follow-up commits before the
  fixture-completeness work concludes.
- **manifest_lint_mode flip** from `spec_branch` to `implementation_pr`
  co-lands with the treatment population in the same atomic merge state per
  §6.5 invariant 3.
- **ROADMAP §3.6.4 description correction** per design doc §9.3 ("Extend
  v3.6.2 sprint contract pattern to the existing `academic-paper`
  writer/evaluator pair via contract-gated phase splits and Schema 13.1
  conditional gates. No new agent files; existing `draft_writer_agent` and
  `peer_reviewer_agent` gain per-phase sub-section instructions") lands in
  the private ROADMAP.md (gitignored, lives in claude-memory-sync), not in
  this repo PR.

## [3.6.7] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Downstream-agent pattern protection layer** (`docs/design/2026-04-29-ars-v3.6.7-downstream-agent-pattern-protection-spec.md`).
  Hardens three downstream agents against 18 hallucination/drift patterns
  documented in the spec: `synthesis_agent` (A1–A5 narrative-side), the
  survey-designer mode of `research_architect_agent` (B1–B5 instrument-side),
  and the abstract-only mode of `report_compiler_agent` (C1–C3 publication-
  side), plus four cross-cutting patterns (D1–D4). Patterns observed in
  production output across multiple chapter-length runs.
- **Four reference files in `shared/references/`** carrying the operational
  contracts that protection clauses cite:
  - `irb_terminology_glossary.md` — anonymity vs confidentiality vs
    de-identification vs pseudonymization (B1).
  - `psychometric_terminology_glossary.md` — true reverse-coded vs contrast
    item, with construct-equivalence rule (B2).
  - `protected_hedging_phrases.md` — five-rule contract for upstream-marked
    hedge protocol (conservative inclusion, anchor every entry, no
    duplicates, verbatim preservation, conflict reporting) (C1).
  - `word_count_conventions.md` — whitespace-split standard (`body.split()`),
    3–5% buffer below hard cap, publisher conventions (C1).
- **Cross-model audit prompt template** at
  `shared/templates/codex_audit_multifile_template.md` — seven audit
  dimensions (cross-ref, hallucination, primary-source integrity, internal
  coherence, instrument quality, Round-N framing, COI adequacy) plus a
  mandatory three-part Section 4(f) check for `report_compiler_agent`
  bundles (whitespace-split cap-minus-buffer, protected-hedge verbatim,
  abstract no less hedged than body — failure of any sub-check is P1).
- **Static lint** at `scripts/check_v3_6_7_pattern_protection.py` enforcing
  protection-clause presence and obligation-phrase shape across the
  reference files, audit template, and three downstream agent prompts.
  Per-regex `allow_prohibition` flag scopes the prohibition exemption so
  prohibition-style obligations (`DO NOT simulate`, `must not claim
  audit-passed state`, `does not paraphrase`) do not leak the exemption to
  assertion-style obligations on the same Check. Span-restricted exemption
  rejects a second prohibition elsewhere in the bullet. Modal/advisory
  weakener coverage: `may`, `should`, `can`, `will`, `would`, `ought to`,
  `ideally`, `preferably`, `We recommend that`, `is/are recommended`,
  `is/are allowed`, `is/are permitted`, plus exception qualifiers
  (`except`, `unless`, `save when`).
- **Mutation test suite** at
  `scripts/test_check_v3_6_7_pattern_protection.py` with 29 tests
  preserving codex review evidence (R2–R6). Future checker regressions
  surface in CI rather than only in ad-hoc mutation runs.
- **CI wiring** in `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` runs both the
  static lint and the mutation suite on every push and pull request.

### Changed

- **`deep-research/agents/synthesis_agent.md`** carries a `PATTERN
  PROTECTION (v3.6.7)` block with five clauses covering effect-inventory
  cross-section consistency self-check, pending-verification hedge wrap,
  one-line anchor justification, verbatim phrase boundary on quotes, and
  the prohibition on declarative claims about un-provided documents
  (with conditional-language fallback).
- **`deep-research/agents/research_architect_agent.md`** survey-designer
  mode carries a `PATTERN PROTECTION (v3.6.7)` block with five clauses
  covering IRB terminology pass-through, reverse-coded construct-
  equivalence justification, event-anchored retrospective default
  (calendar-anchored only when sample shares a common event date),
  neutral-balanced item phrasing with chapter argument vocabulary
  forbidden, and primary-source list enumerate-fully (no subsetting,
  no over-setting, no scope cross-contamination).
- **`deep-research/agents/report_compiler_agent.md`** abstract-only mode
  carries a `PATTERN PROTECTION (v3.6.7)` block with three clauses
  covering whitespace-split word budget plus 3–5% buffer with budget-
  protected hedges, explicit-temporal-bounds reflexivity disclosure
  (year range / past-tense disambiguating verb / "former" prefix; deictic
  phrases forbidden), and the anti-fake-audit guard (DO NOT simulate any
  audit step; DO NOT claim to have run codex/external review; output
  metadata must not claim audit-passed state).

### Notes

- v3.6.7 ships in two stages. **Step 1 + Step 2** (this entry) include
  the four reference files, the audit template, the static lint, the
  mutation test suite, the CI wiring, and the three agent-prompt
  protection blocks. **Step 6** (orchestrator hooks for automatic
  per-agent audit and anti-fake-audit guard wiring) and **Step 8**
  (synthetic evaluation case demonstrating all 18 patterns triggered +
  protected) ship in a follow-up PR. Step 6 is cross-agent runtime work
  that warrants its own design discussion and is intentionally decoupled
  from this prompt-and-lint PR.
- Codex review history: seven rounds of `gpt-5.5` + `xhigh` cross-model
  review reached SHIP-OK with zero P1 + P2 findings. R1 closed ten
  Step-1 findings; R2 closed four cascade gaps plus the per-Check
  `allow_prohibition` leak; R3 closed three P2 findings (span-restricted
  exemption, token→regex with imperative anchoring, `except/unless/
  save when` weakeners); R4 closed three P2 findings (modal verb scope
  expansion, §6 sub-clause coverage, lint→CI wiring); R5 closed one P2
  plus one P3 (`should/can/permitted` modals and the mutation test
  suite); R6 closed one P2 (`will/would/ought to/ideally/preferably/
  We-recommend-that` weakeners) and explicitly deferred orchestrator
  runtime hooks to the Step 6 follow-up PR. R7 surfaced only one P3
  add-counter signal (`try to / generally / where relevant` weakeners),
  which is non-blocking polish.
- ARS pipeline ship-quality target updates from "each agent produces a
  clean v1" to "end-to-end deliverable set passes independent xhigh
  cross-model audit at 0 P1 + P2 finding within three rounds" (per spec
  §10).

## [3.6.5.2] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **`docs/SETUP.md` Method 4 (claude.ai) recommendation revised**. Method 4b
  (Project + GitHub integration) is now presented first as the recommended
  claude.ai path, since it brings the repository into Project knowledge for
  reading and citation without losing fidelity. Method 4a (Custom Skill upload)
  is now explicitly marked as **not recommended for this suite**, with a
  rationale paragraph covering two compounding reasons:
  - ARS depends on Claude Code-only orchestration features. Each skill drives
    12-13 specialised agents through Claude Code's Task / subagent tooling
    and Material Passport file handoffs that resume across sessions.
    claude.ai Custom Skills do support multi-file packages with `scripts/`
    and code execution per Anthropic's documentation, but the Anthropic-
    documented scope of the claude.ai Custom Skill runtime does not include
    Claude Code's Task / subagent control surface or cross-session Material
    Passport handoffs. The recommendation is forward-looking based on those
    documented assumptions; we have not run a live upload to characterise
    the actual surfacing in claude.ai.
  - Trimming the four `description` fields below claude.ai's 200-character cap
    would weaken Claude Code and Cowork routing on the platforms the suite was
    actually built for. The Agent Skills specification and Claude Code Skills
    documentation both allow up to 1,024 characters; only claude.ai's upload
    UI enforces 200. Trading Claude Code and Cowork routing precision for
    partial functionality on the limited claude.ai path was judged not worth
    it.
- **Method 4a install commands kept in place** for users who decide to try it
  anyway, framed as "if you want to try this path despite the limitations"
  rather than as a recommended flow. The upload UI's expected rejection on
  description-too-long is documented as deliberate, not an oversight to fix
  later.
- **`docs/SETUP.zh-TW.md`** mirrors the English changes end-to-end.

### Notes

- Doc-only patch. No `SKILL.md` (frontmatter or body), no agent file, no
  schema, no script, no test, no workflow, and no version bump in any skill
  changed in this patch. The four current `description` fields stay at their
  Claude Code-native lengths (440-842 characters) so routing on Claude Code
  and Cowork remains intact.
- This patch is a scope change from the v3.6.5.2 originally forecast in the
  v3.6.5.1 SETUP doc. The earlier plan was a description trim; on review, the
  trim direction was abandoned because it would have damaged Claude Code and
  Cowork routing to unblock a path that delivers an untested partial fit
  anyway. The v3.6.5.1 SETUP text's forward-promise of a description trim is
  removed here.
- Issue [#44](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/44)
  receives a single consolidated reply on this PR's merge, summarising both
  v3.6.5.1 (SETUP doc rewrite) and v3.6.5.2 (Method 4a recommendation), and
  closes there.

## [3.6.5.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **`docs/SETUP.md` Method 3 install paths** — Option A (symlink) and Option B (copy)
  now install each of the four skill folders separately into `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`,
  matching the `<install-root>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` discovery convention. The previous
  text installed the whole repo under `~/.claude/skills/academic-research-skills/`, which
  buried the four `SKILL.md` files one level too deep for Cowork / Claude Code discovery.
- **`docs/SETUP.md` Method 4 (claude.ai) restructured** — split into Method 4a
  (Custom Skill upload via Settings → Capabilities → Skills, the standard claude.ai Skill
  install path) and Method 4b (Project + GitHub integration, fallback knowledge mode and
  not a Skill install). The previous text framed GitHub integration as a Skill install
  path, which conflated content retrieval with skill execution. Method 4a documents the
  current 200-character `description` cap blocker (this entry originally forecast a
  description trim in v3.6.5.2; see the v3.6.5.2 entry above for the actual decision —
  Method 4a is documented as not recommended for this suite, and descriptions remain at
  their Claude Code-native lengths).
- **Method 3 prerequisites** — expanded from one sentence to a full prerequisites
  subsection covering Claude Desktop version, internet connectivity, Cowork process model,
  folder permissions, paid plan, and Team/Enterprise org-admin controls.
- **Method 4 prerequisites** — split per sub-method. 4a documents zip structure +
  description cap surfacing as upload-time errors; 4b documents GitHub authentication via
  the Anthropic connector, private-repo App authorization, and Team/Enterprise owner-level
  connector enablement.
- **Cowork UI terminology** — replaced "Cowork tab" / "working directory" with current
  Cowork UI labels: mode selector (Chat / Cowork), Tasks view, "Use an existing folder"
  in the left navigation panel, and Cowork Project as the canonical term.
- **Skill invocation framing** — clarified that Claude uses each skill's `description`
  for relevance routing rather than literal trigger-phrase matching, and documented the
  Cowork `/` command palette and `+` capability picker as explicit invocation surfaces.
- **Method 4 directory table** — added the `scripts/` row (required for Material Passport
  `literature_corpus[]` adapters and schema validators) and refreshed the project-capacity
  guidance against current Anthropic Project file limits (per-file 30 MB; file count is
  not artificially capped at 200).
- **`docs/SETUP.zh-TW.md`** — mirrored the English rewrite end-to-end so Traditional
  Chinese readers see the same structure and content for Methods 1-4.
- **`QUICKSTART.md` Step 1** — install commands aligned with the new Method 3 four-symlink
  approach.

### Notes

- Doc-only patch. No skill content (`SKILL.md`), no agent file, no schema, no script,
  and no test changed in this patch.
- Issue [#44](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/44) (philpav)
  reports SETUP problems on Cowork and claude.ai. v3.6.5.1 fixes the SETUP doc;
  this entry originally forecast a `SKILL.md` description-length fix in v3.6.5.2,
  but v3.6.5.2 instead documents Method 4a as not recommended for this suite (see
  the v3.6.5.2 entry above for the actual decision). Issue #44 receives a single
  consolidated reply and closes on v3.6.5.2 ship.

## [3.6.5] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Material Passport `literature_corpus[]` consumer integration in Phase 1
  (deep-research/bibliography_agent + academic-paper/literature_strategist_agent).
  Corpus-first, search-fills-gap flow with PRE-SCREENED reproducibility block.
  Reproducibility for systematic-review use is preserved through Iron Rule 1
  same-criteria parity plus Step 2 case C (standard external search runs even
  when corpus fully covers RQ subtopics).
- `academic-pipeline/references/literature_corpus_consumers.md` — consumer protocol
  reference with four Iron Rules (Same criteria / No silent skip / No corpus mutation /
  Graceful fallback on parse failure) and per-consumer reading instructions.
- `scripts/check_corpus_consumer_protocol.py` — CI lint enforcing nine protocol invariants
  with manifest-driven consumer list and stub-block opt-out.
- `scripts/corpus_consumer_manifest.json` — supported-consumer manifest.

### Changed

- `shared/handoff_schemas.md` Schema 9 — retired the v3.6.4 "Consumer-side integration
  deferred to v3.6.5+" caveat; replaced with backpointer to the consumer protocol.
- `deep-research/SKILL.md` 2.9.1 → 2.9.2 — bibliography_agent corpus-first flow (also
  syncs Version Info footer that lagged at 2.9.0).
- `academic-paper/SKILL.md` 3.1.0 → 3.1.1 — literature_strategist_agent corpus-first flow.
- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` 3.6.4 → 3.6.5 — suite version invariant.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`,
  `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` updated for the version bump (suite version,
  badge, tag, changelog heading).

### Notes

- Consumer integration is presence-based: auto-engages when passport carries a
  non-empty `literature_corpus[]` and parses cleanly. Parse failures fall back
  to external-DB-only flow with a `[CORPUS PARSE FAILURE]` surface. No new env
  flag introduced.
- Schema is unchanged from v3.6.4. Existing user adapters work without modification.
- `citation_compliance_agent` corpus integration deferred to v3.6.6+.
- `source_pointer` is not dereferenced by consumers; URI resolution remains a future
  `source_verification_agent` concern.

## [3.6.4] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Material Passport `literature_corpus[]` input port**. Schema 9 gains an optional `literature_corpus[]` field defined by `shared/contracts/passport/literature_corpus_entry.schema.json`. Each entry carries `citation_key`, CSL-JSON `authors`, `year`, `title`, and a `source_pointer` back to the user's own KB. `abstract` and `user_notes` are private optional fields with copyright caveats.
- **Adapter contract** (`academic-pipeline/references/adapters/overview.md`): language-neutral specification for producing literature_corpus entries from user-owned corpus sources. Covers fail-soft entry-level error handling, mandatory `rejection_log.yaml` output, deterministic ordering (sort by `citation_key` / `source`), and extension points for user-written adapters.
- **Three reference Python adapters** (`scripts/adapters/`): `folder_scan.py` (filesystem of PDFs), `zotero.py` (Better BibTeX JSON export), `obsidian.py` (vault frontmatter, BibTeX-style or literature-note convention). Each ships with pytest tests, fixtures, and golden expected outputs.
- **Rejection log contract** (`shared/contracts/passport/rejection_log.schema.json`). Always emitted; empty when no rejections; closed enum of categorical reason values.
- **CI lint + pytest job**: `scripts/check_literature_corpus_schema.py` (schema + adapter example validation), `scripts/sync_adapter_docs.py --check` (schema→docs drift detector with auto-regen mode), and a new `.github/workflows/pytest.yml` running `scripts/adapters/tests/` on path-filtered triggers.
- `_common.ensure_unique_citekey(key, existing)` helper for adapters whose source already supplies a citekey (zotero, obsidian frontmatter), with sanitization to satisfy the schema pattern and a/b/...zz alpha-suffix collision disambiguation.
- `_common.path_to_file_uri(path)` helper that delegates to `Path.as_uri()` so spaces and reserved characters in filenames are properly percent-encoded.

### Changed

- `academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md`: "deferred to v3.6.4, PR-B" placeholders replaced with forward references to `adapters/overview.md` and `literature_corpus_entry.schema.json`.
- `shared/handoff_schemas.md`: Schema 9 optional fields table adds `literature_corpus`; new "Literature Corpus Input Port (v3.6.4)" subsection appended after Reset Boundary Extension.
- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` bumped 3.6.3 → 3.6.4 (suite version invariant). Other skills retain independent semver.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` updated for the version bump (suite version, badge, tag, changelog heading).

### Not changed (explicit non-goals)

- No ARS agent consumes `literature_corpus[]` yet. Consumer-side integration is deferred to v3.6.5+. v3.6.4 defines the input port only.
- No PDF parsing, no text extraction, no live API clients, no authenticated library crawling. The reference adapters read filenames or local export files and never make network calls.

## [3.6.3] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Opt-in passport reset boundary** via `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET=1`. Every FULL checkpoint becomes a context-reset boundary when the flag is set. `systematic-review` mode with the flag ON makes reset mandatory; other modes treat reset as the flag-gated default.
- **`resume_from_passport=<hash>` mode** in `academic-pipeline`. Lets users resume a pipeline run in a fresh Claude Code session from the Material Passport ledger alone.
- **Schema 9 `reset_boundary[]`** optional append-only field with two entry kinds (`boundary`, `resume`). Entry shape in `shared/contracts/passport/reset_ledger_entry.schema.json` (oneOf split with `kind` discriminator). Hash computed via JSON Canonical Form + SHA-256 with `"000000000000"` placeholder for self-reference safety. Optional `pending_decision` field handles MANDATORY branch choices (Stage 3 reject/restructure/abort, Stage 5 finalization) that survive the reset boundary.
- **Protocol doc:** `academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md` (authoritative; every file mentioning `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET` must co-locate a reference).
- **CI lint:** `scripts/check_passport_reset_contract.py` + unittest suite. Wired into `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`.
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` + `docs/PERFORMANCE.zh-TW.md`** long-running-session subsection documenting when reset beats continuation, passport file-location convention, and empirical-measurement disclaimer.

### Changed
- `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` adds §"Passport Reset Boundary (v3.6.3+)" and §"Resume Mode: `resume_from_passport`". FULL Checkpoint Template includes conditional reset-handoff tag slot.
- `academic-pipeline/references/pipeline_state_machine.md` documents `awaiting_resume` transitions derived from the ledger (no out-of-band state).
- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` adds `resume_from_passport` to the mode table and bumps version 3.6.2 → 3.6.3.
- `shared/handoff_schemas.md` Schema 9 gains `reset_boundary` row + "Reset Boundary Extension (v3.6.3)" subsection with full YAML example showing both kinds.

### Changed (post-P1 fixes)
- `pending_decision.options[]` now carries per-branch routing (`{value, next_stage, next_mode}`); `value` uniqueness within one options array is enforced by CI lint (`scripts/check_passport_reset_contract.py`). The matched option's `next_stage` supersedes the boundary entry's advisory `next` field. `next` MAY be `null` when all branches terminate or no sensible default exists.
- Exclusive advisory lock (POSIX `fcntl.flock LOCK_EX`, bounded timeout not exceeding 60 s, 30 s recommended) is required for the resume read-check-append sequence. Non-POSIX implementations MUST refuse to resume rather than degrade silently.

### Notes
- **Flag OFF is the default.** Pre-v3.6.3 behavior is preserved byte-for-byte when `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET` is unset or `=0`.
- Out of scope (deferred to v3.6.4): `examples/adapters/{folder_scan, zotero, obsidian}/` reference adapters and the `literature_corpus` entry shape on Schema 9.
- No breaking changes. No existing mode behavior changes when the flag is OFF.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Sprint Contract (Schema 13) — reviewer hard gate.** `shared/sprint_contract.schema.json` defines machine-checkable acceptance criteria (`panel_size`, `acceptance_dimensions`, `failure_conditions` with `severity` + `cross_reviewer_quantifier`, `measurement_procedure`, optional `override_ladder`, bounded `agent_amendments`). Validator `scripts/check_sprint_contract.py` (schema validation + `check_structural_invariants()` hard check + nine soft warnings SC-1..SC-11 with SC-6 documented as dead path and SC-8 promoted to hard check). Two templates ship: `shared/contracts/reviewer/full.json` (panel 5) and `shared/contracts/reviewer/methodology_focus.json` (panel 2). Reviewer orchestration reshaped into paper-content-blind Phase 1 + paper-visible Phase 2 hard gate. Synthesizer runs three-step mechanical protocol (build matrix → evaluate with quantifier → resolve precedence). See `docs/design/2026-04-23-ars-v3.6.2-sprint-contract-design.md`.
- **Token cost note.** Reviewer total calls under sprint contract = `2 × panel_size`. For `reviewer_full`: 5 → 10 calls. Phase 1 input is metadata-only and output short, so real token bound is well below 2x.

### Changed

- **`academic-paper-reviewer` v1.8.1 → v1.9.0.** Five reviewer agent markdown files (EIC + methodology + domain + perspective + DA) gain Phase 1/2 protocol sections; `editorial_synthesizer_agent.md` gains the three-step synthesizer protocol + forbidden-operations list.
- **Harness retirement notes folded in.** The prior `[Unreleased]` harness-retirement pass (Task A per `project_ars_v3.6_execution_order.md`) ships with this release — 7 negative-framing blocks rewritten to positive / split form across 7 files, no behaviour change:
  - `academic-paper/agents/socratic_mentor_agent.md` — Core Principles items 1, 6 (F-001)
  - `deep-research/agents/socratic_mentor_agent.md` — Quality Standards items 2, 3, 4 (F-002)
  - `academic-paper/agents/draft_writer_agent.md` — quick style check, paragraph variation, colloquialisms, transition-word usage (F-003, 4 spots)
  - `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` — **split** "Prohibited Actions" (9 items, all negative) into "Scope (delegate, don't perform)" (items 1-6, positive delegation) + "Hard boundaries (never violate)" (items 7-9, kept negative as intentional safety directives for silent-failure modes: fabrication, skipped checkpoints, skipped integrity gates) (F-004)
  - `academic-pipeline/agents/collaboration_depth_agent.md` — Agent-specific boundaries 4 bullets (F-005)
  - `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` — single-line UX guidance (F-006)
  - `academic-paper/references/academic_writing_style.md` — §4 Formality 3 items (F-007, discovered during apply)

### Notes

- `reviewer_re_review`, `reviewer_calibration`, `reviewer_guided` are reserved in the Schema 13 `mode` enum but ship without contract templates in v3.6.2. Those modes continue pre-v3.6.2 behaviour until a follow-up patch adds their templates.
- `reviewer_quick` is intentionally excluded from the Schema 13 `mode` enum (Q3-A' boundary).
- CI gate: `validate-sprint-contracts` step in `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` runs the full unit test suite and validates every template under `shared/contracts/reviewer/*.json` against the current ARS version.
- Kept-as-debt from harness retirement: ~50 anti-hallucination references across `deep-research/`, `academic-paper/references/anti_leakage_protocol.md`, `academic-pipeline/references/ai_research_failure_modes.md`, `shared/agents/compliance_agent.md`, `shared/compliance_checkpoint_protocol.md` — load-bearing integrity architecture (Lu 2026 7-mode; S2 API Tier-0; `[MATERIAL GAP]` taxonomy). Not retired under the iron rule clause for silent-failure domains.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Opt-in Socratic reading-check probe.** When `ARS_SOCRATIC_READING_PROBE=1` is set, the Socratic Mentor fires a one-time honesty probe during goal-oriented sessions where the user has cited a specific paper. The probe asks the user to paraphrase one passage. Decline is logged without penalty. Outcome is recorded in the Research Plan Summary and flows into the Stage 6 AI Self-Reflection Report when the pipeline continues. Default OFF. Roadmap slot: v3.7.3. See `deep-research/agents/socratic_mentor_agent.md` §"Optional Reading Probe Layer".

### Changed

- `deep-research/SKILL.md`, `deep-research/references/socratic_mode_protocol.md`, `academic-pipeline/references/process_summary_protocol.md` — aligned text updates for the new probe section. No behaviour change when the env var is unset.

### Version

- Suite: 3.5.0 → 3.5.1 (patch; opt-in, default OFF, no breaking change)
- `deep-research` skill: 2.9.0 → 2.9.1
- `academic-pipeline` skill: 3.5.0 → 3.5.1 (tracks suite version per `check_version_consistency.py` invariant)

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `shared/collaboration_depth_rubric.md` v1.0 — canonical 4-dimension rubric (Delegation Intensity, Cognitive Vigilance, Cognitive Reallocation, Zone Classification). Based on Wang, S., & Zhang, H. (2026). "Pedagogical partnerships with generative AI in higher education: how dual cognitive pathways paradoxically enable transformative learning." *International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education*, 23:11. DOI 10.1186/s41239-026-00585-x. Licensed CC-BY-NC 4.0.
- `academic-pipeline/agents/collaboration_depth_agent.md` — observer agent (Agent Team grows 3 → 4). Invoked at every FULL/SLIM checkpoint and at pipeline completion; scores user-AI collaboration pattern against the canonical rubric. **Advisory only — never blocks progression.** Frontmatter declares `blocking: false`, `measures: collaboration_depth`, `rubric_ref: shared/collaboration_depth_rubric.md`.
- `scripts/check_collaboration_depth_rubric.py` + `scripts/test_check_collaboration_depth_rubric.py` — new lint enforces: (1) rubric file exists; (2) rubric cites Wang & Zhang 2026 with DOI; (3) `rubric_version` frontmatter field; (4) four canonical dimension headings; (5)/(6) any agent claiming `measures: collaboration_depth` references the canonical rubric path and declares `blocking: false`; (7)/(8) orchestrator and SKILL.md mention observer with non-blocking semantics. 10 unit tests, all green.
- `academic-pipeline/references/changelog.md` row v2.8.
- `academic-pipeline/references/reinforcement_content.md` row for FULL/SLIM checkpoint — IRON RULE: observer is advisory only, never blocks, never a leaderboard.

### Changed
- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` — version bump `3.3.0 → 3.4.0`. Agent Team table grows to 4 rows. New "Collaboration Depth Observer" section with explicit non-blocking guarantees and distinction from integrity verification and Stage 6 self-reflection. Reference Files table adds rubric entry.
- `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md` — checkpoint Steps flow amended: after `state_tracker` update the orchestrator invokes `collaboration_depth_agent` on the just-completed stage's dialogue range (FULL/SLIM only; MANDATORY integrity gates explicitly skip) and injects its output into checkpoint templates as a named "Collaboration Depth" section. FULL checkpoint template expanded with the observer block; SLIM template gains a one-line compact observer summary; MANDATORY template unchanged (integrity gates never dilute). New "Collaboration Depth Observer" subsection under §3 Checkpoint Management covers invocation, cross-model behaviour, short-stage guard, and non-blocking IRON RULE.
- `academic-pipeline/agents/state_tracker_agent.md` — Write Access Control adds `collaboration_depth_agent` (append-only `collaboration_depth_history[]`). New `dialogue_log_ref` turn-range pointer per stage; new `collaboration_depth_history[]` root-level array; new `append_observer_report()` function (only function that writes the history; preconditions block any attempt to turn observer output into a blocking condition).
- `scripts/_skill_lint.py` — new shared `split_frontmatter(text) -> (dict|None, str)` lenient helper, reused by the new lint.
- Suite version bumped to `3.5.0` across `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; new `### v3.5.0 (2026-04-21)` section in both READMEs; new `## v3.5 Key Additions` block in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` — README version expectations bumped to `v3.5.0`; `MODE_REGISTRY.md` last-updated expectation updated; `.claude/CLAUDE.md` suite version expectation updated. New embedded-changelog regression checks for `### v3.5.0 (2026-04-21)` entries.

### Notes
- MANDATORY integrity checkpoints (Stages 2.5, 4.5) are **not** instrumented by the observer. The observer never appears in the "Flagged" line of any checkpoint. `blocked_by: collaboration_depth_agent` is never a legal state. The orchestrator's numbered Step 3 explicitly branches on checkpoint_type.
- Cross-model behaviour (`ARS_CROSS_MODEL`): observer runs on both models; dimension disagreement > 2 points is flagged explicitly, never silently averaged. `ARS_CROSS_MODEL_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` escape hatch documented.
- Short-stage guard: if the completed stage has fewer than 5 user turns, a static `insufficient_evidence` block is injected and the full-model observer call is skipped.
- Credit: Wang & Zhang (2026) introduced the dual-pathway SEM and three-zone (Zone 1 / Zone 2 / Zone 3) framework that anchors the rubric's dimension operationalisation and synthesis rule.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `shared/agents/compliance_agent.md` — single mode-aware agent for PRISMA-trAIce + RAISE compliance. Dispatches on `compliance_mode ∈ {systematic_review, primary_research, other_evidence_synthesis}`. See design spec `docs/design/2026-04-20-v3.4-prisma-trAIce-raise-readcheck-design.md`.
- `shared/prisma_trAIce_protocol.md` — verbatim 17-item snapshot from `cqh4046/PRISMA-trAIce` (2025-12-10) + per-item ARS check procedure + 4-tier behaviour table. Citation: Holst et al. 2025, JMIR AI, doi:10.2196/80247.
- `shared/raise_framework.md` — 4 principles (human oversight / transparency / reproducibility / fit-for-purpose) + 8-role matrix + mandatory scope disclaimer. Citation: Thomas et al. 2025, NIHR ESG Best Practice Working Group, 17 July 2025.
- `shared/compliance_checkpoint_protocol.md` — Stage 2.5 / 4.5 dual-gate behaviour spec, decision precedence, override ladder, fail-loop integration, boundary behaviour for non-pipeline invocation.
- `shared/compliance_report.schema.json` — Schema 12 validator (Draft 2020-12).
- `examples/compliance/fixture_sr_full_compliant.yaml`, `fixture_sr_missing_M4.yaml`, `fixture_primary_raise_weak.yaml` — regression fixtures + user reference templates.
- `scripts/check_compliance_report.py` + tests — Schema 12 CLI validator.
- `scripts/validate_compliance_fixtures.py` + tests — YAML→JSON fixture loop used by CI.
- `scripts/check_prisma_trAIce_freshness.py` + tests — non-blocking upstream-drift warning (180-day threshold).
- `.github/workflows/freshness-check.yml` — weekly cron (Monday 09:00 UTC) + path-filtered push trigger for freshness check.
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` + `.zh-TW.md`: new "Long-running session management" section + v3.4.0 token-cost deltas.

### Changed

- `shared/handoff_schemas.md`: Schema 12 pointer + Material Passport `compliance_history[]` (append-only audit trail).
- `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` (v3.2.2 → v3.3.0): Stage 2.5 / 4.5 extended with compliance payload; checkpoint dashboard gains compliance row.
- `deep-research/SKILL.md` (v2.8.1 → v2.9.0): `systematic-review` mode now triggers `compliance_agent` at both gates.
- `academic-paper/SKILL.md` (v3.0.2 → v3.1.0): `full` mode adds pre-finalize RAISE principles-only check (warn-only). `disclosure` mode unchanged and complementary.
- `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`: added compliance validator + unit test runner steps.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py`: version pins bumped.
- `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`: suite version → 3.4.0.

### Notes

- Calibration philosophy: compliance_agent ships with transparent reporting, **no hard FNR/FPR threshold**. This is self-consistent with ARS's v3.3.2 `task_type: open-ended` truth-in-advertising annotation — publishing a hard gate would contradict the "not a benchmark task" declaration.
- Compliance Mandatory failures in SR mode are blocking, but the 3-round override ladder preserves human-in-the-loop authority. Overrides auto-inject `disclosure_addendum` into the final manuscript — no detection evasion.
- The v3.2 Failure Mode Checklist and the v3.4.0 compliance agent run in parallel at the same gates. Their scopes are non-overlapping: failure-mode checks research validity; compliance checks reporting transparency.
- Internal numbering: compliance_report is Schema 12 (not 10). Schema 10 is Style Profile (v2.7+); Schema 11 is R&R Traceability Matrix. The plan's initial Schema 10 assignment was corrected mid-branch before Task 9.

## [3.3.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — single source of truth for pipeline structure (flow, stage × dimension matrix, data-access flow, skill dependency graph, quality gates, modes). Merged into main via PR #18.
- `docs/SETUP.md` + `docs/SETUP.zh-TW.md` — prerequisites, API keys, Pandoc / tectonic setup, cross-model verification (`ARS_CROSS_MODEL`), and four installation methods.
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` + `docs/PERFORMANCE.zh-TW.md` — per-mode token budgets, full-pipeline cost estimate, and recommended Claude Code settings (Agent Team, Ralph Loop, Skip Permissions).

### Changed
- `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md` streamlined: removed the ASCII pipeline diagram and the 16-point key-feature list (superseded by `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Setup, performance, and installation sections relocated to `docs/`. Skill Details now anchors version numbers and routes readers to ARCHITECTURE.md §3 for per-agent rosters.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` — bumped README version expectations to `v3.3.6`; DOCX contract expectations (both EN and zh-TW) moved from READMEs to the new `docs/SETUP.*` docs; added `check_setup_docs()` step.
- Suite version bumped to `3.3.6` across `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and `MODE_REGISTRY.md`.

### Notes
- No functional change to any skill. Pure documentation reorganization.

## [3.3.5] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `shared/benchmark_report.schema.json` — JSON Schema (draft-2020-12) defining required fields for ARS benchmark reports. Catches the "n=2 author-conducted baseline" failure mode from Anthropic's automated-w2s-researcher paper.
- `shared/benchmark_report_pattern.md` — narrative hub doc explaining the schema.
- `scripts/check_benchmark_report.py` + tests — validator with self-scored and small-sample warnings.
- `examples/benchmark_report_template.json` — fillable template.
- `repro_lock` optional sub-block added to Material Passport (Schema 9 in `shared/handoff_schemas.md`). Configuration lockfile; NOT a deterministic replay guarantee.
- `shared/artifact_reproducibility_pattern.md` — hub doc with mandatory "not a replay guarantee" disclaimer section and required `stochasticity_declaration` field.
- `scripts/check_repro_lock.py` + tests — passport validator.
- `examples/passport_with_repro_lock.yaml` — example.
- `requirements-dev.txt` — formal Python dev dep manifest (pyyaml + jsonschema).

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` installs via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` instead of ad-hoc `pip install`.
- `academic-pipeline/references/reproducibility_audit.md` cross-links to new artifact-reproducibility pattern.

## [3.3.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Embedded changelog sections in `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md` now include the missing `v3.3.3` and `v3.3.2` summaries, so the README history matches the published releases.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` now verifies that the README changelog summaries include the latest release entries, so future drift fails CI.

### Changed
- Suite version bumped to `3.3.4` across release-facing docs after the README changelog sync patch release.

## [3.3.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `scripts/_skill_lint.py` now rejects SKILL frontmatter that is missing a closing `---` fence instead of silently treating the rest of the file as YAML.
- `scripts/_skill_lint.py` now reports a readable error when frontmatter parses as valid YAML but not as a mapping object, instead of crashing with `AttributeError`.
- Broken showcase link for the post-publication audit report corrected in both `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md`.
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` now validates README relative Markdown links so future dead links fail CI.

### Changed
- DOCX generation contract aligned across README, `academic-paper/SKILL.md`, `academic-paper/agents/formatter_agent.md`, `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md`, and `academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md`: direct `.docx` output is Pandoc-dependent, with Markdown + conversion instructions as the fallback.
- Added regression tests covering missing closing fences and non-mapping YAML frontmatter in both lint test suites.
- Suite version bumped to `3.3.3` across release-facing docs; `academic-paper` patch-bumped to `3.0.2` and `academic-pipeline` patch-bumped to `3.2.2`.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `metadata.data_access_level` field on every top-level SKILL.md. Three-tier vocabulary (`raw` | `redacted` | `verified_only`) declaring what kind of data each skill may consume. Inspired by the three-tier isolation pattern in Anthropic's automated-w2s-researcher (2026).
  - `deep-research` = `raw`
  - `academic-paper` = `redacted`
  - `academic-paper-reviewer` = `verified_only`
  - `academic-pipeline` = `verified_only`
- `scripts/check_data_access_level.py` lint script with unit tests; wired into `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml`.
- Pointer section in `shared/handoff_schemas.md` documenting the vocabulary for future skill authors.
- `metadata.task_type` field on every top-level SKILL.md. Two-value vocabulary (`open-ended` | `outcome-gradable`) declaring whether the task has a scalar ground-truth metric. All current ARS skills are `open-ended` — the field is a truth-in-advertising signal that ARS targets domain-judgment work, not benchmark tasks.
- `scripts/check_task_type.py` lint script with 4 unit tests; wired into the same CI workflow.
- Pointer section in `shared/handoff_schemas.md` for the `task_type` vocabulary.
- `shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md` — narrative pattern doc explaining the three-layer model behind `data_access_level` and `task_type`. Cross-references existing protocols (S2 verification, anti-leakage, integrity gates, calibration mode). Linked from `handoff_schemas.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Changed
- Per-skill `metadata.version` patch-bumped on all 4 SKILL.md files; `last_updated` refreshed to 2026-04-15.
- Suite version bumped to 3.3.2 across `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Public contract drift across `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`, and the affected `SKILL.md` files
- Cross-model wording now matches the implemented scope: integrity sample verification and independent DA critique are shipped; sixth-reviewer peer review remains planned
- `academic-pipeline` checkpoint docs now state that SLIM checkpoints still wait for explicit user confirmation
- `academic-pipeline` integrity gate docs now consistently state that Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 cannot be skipped
- `academic-paper/SKILL.md` mode-count heading and `academic-paper-reviewer/SKILL.md` Version Info block

### Added
- `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` to catch mode-count, version-block, and forbidden-claim drift
- `.github/workflows/spec-consistency.yml` to run the consistency check on pushes and pull requests

## [3.3] - 2026-04-09

### Added — PaperOrchestra-inspired enhancements
Integrates techniques from Song et al. (2026, *arXiv:2604.05018*) "PaperOrchestra: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated AI Research Paper Writing."

- **Semantic Scholar API Verification** (deep-research, academic-pipeline): Tier 0 programmatic reference verification via S2 API. Title search with Levenshtein >= 0.70 matching. DOI mismatch detection for Compound Deception Pattern #5. Bibliography deduplication via S2 IDs. Graceful degradation if API unavailable.
  - New file: `deep-research/references/semantic_scholar_api_protocol.md`
  - Modified: `source_verification_agent`, `bibliography_agent`, `integrity_verification_agent`
- **Anti-Leakage Protocol** (academic-paper, deep-research): Knowledge Isolation Directive prioritizes session materials over LLM parametric memory for factual content. Flags `[MATERIAL GAP]` for missing content instead of silently filling from memory. Reduces Mode 5/6 failure risk.
  - New file: `academic-paper/references/anti_leakage_protocol.md`
  - Modified: `draft_writer_agent`, `report_compiler_agent`
- **VLM Figure Verification** (academic-paper): Optional closed-loop verification of rendered figures using vision-capable LLM. 10-point checklist covering data accuracy, APA 7.0 compliance, and visual quality. Max 2 refinement iterations.
  - New file: `academic-paper/references/vlm_figure_verification.md`
  - Modified: `visualization_agent`
- **Score Trajectory Protocol** (academic-pipeline): Per-dimension rubric score delta tracking across revision rounds. Detects regressions (delta < -3) and triggers mandatory checkpoint. Extends v3.2 early-stopping with dimension-level granularity.
  - New file: `academic-pipeline/references/score_trajectory_protocol.md`
  - Modified: `integrity_review_protocol.md`, `handoff_schemas.md` (Schema 5)
- **Stage 2 Parallelization Directive** (academic-pipeline): Visualization and argument building can run in parallel after outline completion.
- **Handoff Schema Updates** (shared): `semantic_scholar_id` field added to Bibliography source object. `score_trajectory` structure added to Integrity Report schema.

**Version bumps**: deep-research v2.8, academic-paper v3.0, academic-pipeline v3.2

## [3.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added — Lu 2026 integration
Integrates insights from Lu et al. (2026, *Nature* 651:914-919) — the first end-to-end autonomous AI research system to pass blind peer review.

- **AI Research Failure Mode Checklist** (academic-pipeline): 7-mode taxonomy extending the existing 5-type citation hallucination taxonomy. Covers implementation-bug blindness, hallucinated experimental results, shortcut reliance, bug-as-insight, methodology fabrication, and pipeline-level frame-lock. Runs at Stage 2.5 and 4.5 with mandatory blocking behaviour. Reported at Stage 6 in the Failure Mode Audit Log subsection of the AI Self-Reflection Report.
  - New file: `academic-pipeline/references/ai_research_failure_modes.md`
- **Reviewer Calibration Mode** (academic-paper-reviewer v1.8): opt-in mode that measures FNR / FPR / balanced accuracy / AUC against a user-supplied gold-standard set of 5-20 papers. Uses 5x ensembling with fresh context per run. Cross-model verification default-on. Session-scoped confidence disclosure.
  - New file: `academic-paper-reviewer/references/calibration_mode_protocol.md`
- **Disclosure Mode** (academic-paper v2.9): venue-specific AI-usage disclosure statement generator. v1 database covers ICLR, NeurIPS, Nature, Science, ACL, EMNLP. Unknown venues halt and prompt user to paste policy.
  - New files: `academic-paper/references/disclosure_mode_protocol.md`, `academic-paper/references/venue_disclosure_policies.md`
- **Fidelity-Originality Mode Spectrum** (all skills): classifies all modes on a fidelity–originality axis per Lu 2026 Fig 1c. Quick Mode Selection Guides updated with Spectrum column.
  - New file: `shared/mode_spectrum.md`
- **Early-Stopping Criterion** (academic-pipeline v3.1): convergence check (delta < 3 points + no P0) suggests stopping revision loop. Budget transparency estimate at pipeline start.
- **README Positioning Update**: "Why human-in-the-loop, not full automation?" section citing Lu 2026 as external evidence for ARS's design thesis. Both EN and zh-TW updated.

### Changed
